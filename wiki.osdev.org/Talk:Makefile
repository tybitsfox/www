<p>Sorry for taking so long to reply, I'm not a "regular" to the new Wiki (yet?). Candy, you are of course right about the $(RM) implicit variable. The "if"-wrapper is being done to keep the Makefile quiet even if a file from the list does not exist (which is not, in fact, an error, and thus shouldn't bother the user). I know I had problems with "only" rm -f to this end, but would have to do some testing to give an exact explanation.
As for the "arrogance" part... you can't write "the" tutorial about makefiles, because make is far too diverse. You can use them to run everything and the kitchen sink. I thought the PDCLib Makefile - being AFAIK correct, non-trivial, and yet not overly long / complex - would be a good example for others to learn a few tricks about Makefiles, especially the dependency handling and non-recursiveness. I shall make the wording a bit more general, and add a note that this is meant as a <i>starting-point</i>, with feedback / requests for extensions being very welcome.

a failure will stop any other rules that may be in that target from being run, but that's correct bahavior anyway.

<dl><dd>And it's actually the other way around - recursive Makefiles are always in danger of not representing the whole dependency graph, and the more processes you run in parallel, the higher the chances to break something. Monolithic Makefiles don't suffer from this problem.</dd>
<dd>The parallelity doesn't come from multiple <i>Makefiles</i> being executed in parallel, but in multiple <i>rules</i> being run.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Extended_todolist...">Extended todolist...</span></h2>
<p>I disagree with Virtlink's edit <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://wiki.osdev.org/index.php?title=Makefile&amp;diff=6210&amp;oldid=6209">[1]</a>. Indeed in the PDCLib makefile that was the "template" for this article, I have two different targets, one for TODO: comments and one for FIXME: comments, as the two represent very different levels of urgency; I only presented one of the two as I felt it would be trivial to adapt this to personal choice. You usually don't want TODOs in a FIXME-list, and vice versa. The -F option may make the grep faster, but I feel it's a bit non-KISS. And while we're at it printing file names, why not line numbers to go? Suggestion:
</p>
<pre>todolist:
-@for file in $(ALLFILES); do grep -Hn TODO $$file; done; true
</pre>
<p>This will print a list of all <i>TODO</i> comments from my files, complete with file name and line number. Nice to be remembered what's still missing before you do a release.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<dl><dd>'fgrep' seems simple enough, and has advantages, especially when you have a big project to build. On the other hand, '-Hn' (or '-H' for that matter) seems also a bit non-KISS to me, however it may be useful. And it is not that trivial to add another keyword, because you need the '-e' switch for that. To me (any possibly to you too), FIXME's are more urgent than TODO's (in the spirit of 'what's missing before you do a release') so maybe we should use those in the example instead. I suggest the following (or with 'fixme' replaced by 'todo'): <a href="./User:Virtlink" title="User:Virtlink">Virtlink</a> 16:03, 20 August 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<pre>fixmelist:
    -@for file in $(ALLFILES); do fgrep -Hn -e FIXME $$file; done; true
</pre>
<dl><dd>This will <i>grep</i> all those <i>FIXME</i> comments from the files and display them in the terminal. It's nice to be remembered of what's still missing before you do a release. To add another keyword, just add another <code>-e keyword</code>. Don't forget to add <code>fixmelist</code> to your <code>.PHONY</code> list.</dd></dl>

<p>I have added two sections into this article and felt they required a brief spot of justification.  Whilst the prerequisites for this wiki include an in-depth knowledge of C, not all flavours of C (maily the Microsoft flavours) use makefiles and some people (like myself) can have survived their whole life of C experience never even having laid eyes on a Makefile.  The first section, "What is a Makefile?", is my attempt to bridge this gap and hopefully convey some of the benefits of having one of these.
Moving on, I have added the most basic of basic examples that I could think of to address the fact that the first actual look at a makefile appears more than half way down this fairly sizable beginner tutorial document.
I hope I'm not treading on anyone's toes here, the tutorial is very good, but speaking from the starting point of my experience it needed this little intro.

<h2><span id="Which_make_to_target.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Which_make_to_target?">Which make to target?</span></h2>
<p>Should this article target GNU make or POSIX make? I think it wouldn't be bad idea to rewrite this article to conform POSIX, because those features can be trusted to be available unlike some GNU extensions (try to look for pattern rules in pmake, for example), and if someone wants to know if his/her specific make know some fancier tricks, the manual is available. Maybe some tricks could be even shortly listed in the end of the article. After quick skimming I noticed two things which would need changing, pattern rules and usage of <tt>:=</tt> to create macros. IMO at least it should be noted that this article talks about GNU make.
</p><p>And by the way, usage of <tt>=</tt> to create macros can also be sign of trying to be portable instead of an error... <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/index.php?title=User:Fronty&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Fronty (page does not exist)">Fronty</a> 20:58, 6 April 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>It <i>does</i> say it is targeting GNU make, right in the intro of the Tutorial section. There are several reasons I wrote it like this.</dd>
<dd>First, I did not write this tutorial in limbo; the example Makefile presented closely reflects the Makefile I use for PDCLib. Any error I find there gets corrected here, too, which likely wouldn't happen if this tutorial were not connected to a "live" Makefile like that. (And there have been a couple of errors over time, like a complete screw-up of dependency handling I would never have discovered if it had been tutorial code only.)</dd>
<dd>All platforms I have access to, both privately and professionally, have a GNU make installation on them, or could be fitted with one in <i>no</i> time (make being one of the few tools having <i>zero</i> dependencies and making true of the <tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make install</tt> promise). And figuring out <i>one</i> make manual was quite enough for me. Two reasons I don't feel like digging through other make's manuals to find out the common denominator...</dd>
<dd>Then there's the thing with common denominators... <tt>=</tt> may be more portable, but it is <i>also</i> highly <i>inefficient</i> (as the expression gets re-evaluated every time it appears in a rule). There is no such thing as the <tt>.PHONY</tt> target in POSIX make (I just checked), so you're open for faulty behaviour on that flank.</dd>
<dd>That's not touching on where I simply prefer the GNU notation (e.g. "%.o: %c") over the POSIX one (".c.o:") for expressiveness.</dd>
<dd>Bottom line, if you insist on re-structuring this tutorial to target POSIX instead of GNU make, I won't be starting an edit war over it, :but I think GNU make has some distinct advantages. -- <a href="./User:Solar" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 13:15, 7 April 2011 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I kind of like the idea of portable makefiles but to be fair, it's better to be practical sometimes. The POSIX <i>make</i> is sort of rudimentary; I don't even know any projects actually trying to achieve <i>make</i> compatibility. Furthermore, most people are turning away from make (IMHO, for good reason). --<a href="./User:Love4boobies" title="User:Love4boobies">Love4boobies</a> 15:59, 7 April 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>"Most people are turning away from make"? Not in the C/C++ world, they don't. (CMake, Automake, they all use make in the end, and I haven't heard of any non-make alternative making the mainstream.) -- <a href="./User:Solar" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 05:15, 8 April 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Fair enough but in the same sense that CMake uses make, C compilers usually use assembly. What I meant was that makefiles tend to become very cumbersome for larger projects and that makes people want to learn something else instead. --<a href="./User:Love4boobies" title="User:Love4boobies">Love4boobies</a> 08:22, 8 April 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I don't understand how I could miss that GNU make really is mentioned. Maybe I really should grep more thoroughly before complaining.&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>Yes, I missed .PHONY target. That isn't very big problem, though. The trick is to add a dummy dependency which does nothing to a phony target. Maybe it isn't beautiful, but .PHONY IMO is quite ugly too.</dd>
<dd>I checked out PDCLib to see how much worse would the build time be if all the <tt>:=</tt> would be changed to <tt>=</tt> when built with GNU make on Ubuntu 10.04 live cd (my FreeBSD installation has some attitude problems right now). Worst differences were about 0.5s, best differences under 0.1s. I got similar results with version Ubuntu stock make (version 3.81) and 3.75 built from source, so I think this isn't due to some relatively new optimization. I don't think that is highly inefficient.</dd>
<dd>So... Looks like we're going to live rest of our lives happily with our opinions on efficiency and aesthetics and compatibility and hope we don't stomp on other's feet. <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/index.php?title=User:Fronty&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Fronty (page does not exist)">Fronty</a> 16:50, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>This whole page is for people who want to make a good Makefile, not for comparing build systems in general. Make is <i>quite</i> up to the task, it's just that few people ever bothered to actually <i>learn</i> how to use make efficiently. Oh, and your "trick" for .PHONY doesn't work, if you think about it for a second. (What happens when a file with the name of the dependency exists?) <i>And</i> you can hardly argue with "getting cumbersome for large projects" on the one hand and the comparatively simple PDCLib not making much of a difference on the other hand. Hey, just buy a computer that's twice as fast, and you can get away with crappy algorithms? I don't think so. -- <a href="./User:Solar" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 08:14, 11 April 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>This whole page is about that, and this whole discussion is about what does a good Makefile mean, and I think we have found out what is public's opinion on that.</dd>
<dd>Yes, I know the .PHONY "trick" isn't completely foolproof, but IMO double check is good enough in this kind of situation. What the heck are some extra files doing in the source/build directory anyway? This can be always argued, though.</dd>
<dd>Yes, I understand that PDClib is quite simple project. However, that shows well enough that the impact of the type of macro doesn't have that big impact on build speed that I would care. I don't care if my nightly builds are ready a little earlier or later. Full build won't be once-in-an-hour event while developing, and I'll be making tea or something while my computer is installing something and I don't think someone who has already chosen the slow path will want to stare the compilation the whole time. You won't have anything magical in the macros, maybe to the macros containing list of source and object files will be a bit fancier, but they aren't used very much.</dd>
<dd>Can I get away with crappy algorithms with faster computer? No. Can I use maybe a little slower algorithm with some good characteristics if the speed difference won't make any difference in that situation and I fancy the good characteristics? Yes. <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/index.php?title=User:Fronty&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Fronty (page does not exist)">Fronty</a> 13:56, 11 April 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
