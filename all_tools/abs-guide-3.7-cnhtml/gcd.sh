# gcd.sh: greatest common divisor
#         Uses Euclid's algorithm

#  The "greatest common divisor" (gcd) of two integers
#+ is the largest integer that will divide both, leaving no remainder.

#  Euclid's algorithm uses successive division.
#  In each pass,
#+ dividend &lt;---  divisor
#+ divisor  &lt;---  remainder
#+ until remainder = 0.
#+ The gcd = dividend, on the final pass.
#
#  For an excellent discussion of Euclid's algorithm, see
#  Jim Loy's site, http://www.jimloy.com/number/euclids.htm.
