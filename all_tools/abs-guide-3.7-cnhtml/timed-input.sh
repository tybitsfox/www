#  Admittedly, this is a kludgy implementation of timed input,
#+ however the "-t" option to "read" simplifies this task.
#  See "t-out.sh", below.

#  If you need something really elegant...
#+ consider writing the application in C or C++,
#+ using appropriate library functions, such as 'alarm' and 'setitimer'.
