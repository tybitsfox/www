1. Introduction


1.1. Welcome, Great Warriors!

Once there was a Lucky Panel Guide that contained other strategic sections
also, and here is this strategic FAQ that contains a Lucky Panel section also.
From a worm to a butterfly (or rather an ugly moth, you will tell).
 DW7 is very easy to play (simple menus, few buttons), however, behind the
cover there is a very difficult system of rules. For example there are six
different kinds of fire based damage. It's a miracle that this game runs. It
runs, but...there are some strange things I wonder they did them on purpose or
accidentally.
 This document does not include everything, there are many guides for this
game, so I put things in that I consider important or missing from the other
guides. It may contain spoilers for you (Monster List, Treasure List), but it
does not mention the story, it explains the game only strategically.


1.2. The Ultimate Strategy

If you don't like battles and strategies, and you want only the story and to
play Dragon Warrior 7 like an adventure game, you don't need to read the other
parts of this FAQ, because here is the Ultimate Strategy, a cheat:

80010C60 00E8
80010C62 0203

These GameShark codes put two items in your hero's inventory, so you must empty
it before you use the codes, because they will replace any item that is in
slot 1 and slot 2. After you loaded DW7 with the codes and you "obtained" the
two items, save your game immediately and reset your PlayStation, and reload
DW7 again without the codes. You will be able to play safely further on, the
game itself uses these items (perhaps they were made for beta testers):

GospelO
Equip it to one of your characters and you will avoid every random battle. This
is a normal item in the game, but you will get it so late, that it's completely
useless.

MimicCrag
There will be numerous and difficult battles that you won't be able to avoid by
the GospelO, so here is this item for them. It is to use in battle. It erases
everything that gets in your way.


1.3. How to Use This FAQ

This document is huge. I recommend you to use the Find Word tools of your file
viewer. This way you can avoid the spoiler-dangerous parts and quickly find the
info you need.
 If you don't get a sense of an expression I used, maybe you should check other
similar sections where you may find explanations for that. However, I don't
think this FAQ should be so hard to understand. If you know what info you want
to find and utilize in your quest, you will get along.


1.4. Abbreviations in Item Names

Attempting to follow DW7 item name design I use these (limited) ASCII symbols
in the entire document:

/ = Symbol of Knife, Sword, Bat, Lance, Staff;
\ = Symbol of Hammer;
~ = Symbol of Whip;
W = Symbol of Claw;
) = Symbol of Axe;
7 = Symbol of Boomerang;
Y = Symbol of Fan;
V = Symbol of Shield, Mask;
^ = Symbol of Cap, Helm, Hair-band;
T = Symbol of Shirt, Robe, Bustier;
# = Symbol of Armor;
H = Symbol of Breastplate, Leotard;
_ = Symbol of Pants;
O = Symbol of Ring;
v = Symbol of Heart;
k = Symbol of Key;
@ = Symbol of Scroll;


2. Game Rule Explanations


2.1. Character Info

You, the Hero, have a few friends who acompany you in your quest to save the
world, it is Your party, you and they are the "characters" who fight the
monsters. Your characters have some parameters ("stats") that are important to
win battles.

Name

In the beginning you choose a name for your hero, and later in the game there
will be a point where you can modify not only your hero's name, but the other
characters' also (Dharma Temple).


Class

Now, this is an important parameter. Every character has a basic class or
rather "No class". Maribel is FishDghtr (fisher's daughter), and she has stats
determined in advance. When she levels up, she will get certain pluses and may
learn certain spells/skills, independent from her actual class she had been
changed to. For example if you change Maribel to a class that has higher HP and
go through many a level-up, she won't get more HP in the end than she had had
leveling up as FishDghtr. And the same goes with the stat-increasing seeds. If
you use a LifeAcorn on her and you read "Maribel's HP was raised by 5!", that's
really 4 or even less. If you want to use up seeds at the highest efficiency,
you'd better change your character to No class just to see the real amounts.
 Each Character Class has certain resistance points that are well hidden from
your eyes, but as you fight and take numerous kinds of damage you will see the
differences. I am sorry that this FAQ doesn't contain a resistance list, but
whenever I can get a sound data I will put it in. D. Short's Job Guide has a
list, but that covers only about the half of all.
 Some classes, especially the advanced classes, have certain bonus effects.
There are some that can stun enemies randomly (TeenIdol, Bombcrag, JewelBag,
EvilWell), and some that can steal items from battles (Thief, Pirate, Budoo),
or other useful battle effects (Critical hits, Vital blows, Rebound fire, HP
regeneration, MP discount, etc.). So classes are not just for learning skills
and spells.


Class Level

The original classes do not have a class level. When you change your class to
a new one, that class starts at the first level. Each level has a fancy name,
but the white or golden star(s) indicates it better. Your class level will
slowly raise (up to eighth) if you fight "strong enough enemies". The only
thing that counts is the number of battles when you defeat at least one
monster. If you kill hundreds of the most difficult enemies in one single
battle, that will be equal when you kill a single one of the weakest in the
proper area. So don't look at the monsters, but look at the place where you
fight and your characters' levels. Every area/dungeon has a certain level limit
that determines whether your characters gain a class level point or not. What
monsters reside in a place, that doesn't matter. It is wise to check out
whether you still gain class points every time you level up. If you don't, then
you should find a new place to train your characters. Even the very battle
where you have just leveled up over the level limit doesn't count. Battles
against bosses and mini-bosses (Mimic, EvilWell, etc.) don't count. Battles
when all monsters fled or were banished, and battles when your party fled or
were wiped out no matter how many monsters you killed also don't count.
 As you advance class levels, certain class parameters, bonus effects may be
triggered. This is when you may learn a new skill or spell.
 When your class reaches the eighth level, you have mastered that class. The
white stars turn to golden. This time some parameters of your character may
increase (mastery bonus). Even if you don't need the skills of a class, you
might need to master it for its good parameters at master level (WRF Ranking).


Sex

It isn't significant. The effect of a skill called PuffPuff is Sex dependent.


Level

Very important. After earning a certain amount of experience points (generally
from battles) your characters will advance one (or more) level(s) and their
parameters may be increased by certain (and not random) values. But Level isn't
just an indicator of your characters' status. It has influence to some things:
-As I explained above, it determines the class-level-ups.
-If Hero's level is too low, random monsters will attack even if you want to
 avoid them (Repellent, Repel spell).
-The success of your attempt of escaping from a battle depends on whether
 Hero's Lv has reached the low-level of the current area or not. If monsters
 "are stunned" or "haven't noticed yet", you can always escape.
-Monsters that can flee from battles flee more often when your level is
 higher than the low-level of the current area.
-The damage of some skills is Level dependent (WindBeast, Vacuum, Howl).


Strength

Your STR and weapon power make your attack power (ATK). If you rely on attack
skills, the higher your STR is the better. You can be awarded by the WRF for
your high enough STR, however, you should care for the order of winnings if you
want your weaker characters, too, to win the STR Award lest your strongest
character make it impossible.


Agility

This parameter determines the order of actions of your party and monsters. It
is good if your characters can precede the enemy action, but not always. You
should look at AGL when you make your plans in battles. And you will fail
sometimes because the program makes a random number out of AGL and that number
sets the order of actions really. I believe the higher the differences between
the AGLs of your characters the better. There are some initiative skills and
spells that are independent from AGL (Guardian, Ironize, MagicBack).


Guard

It is a character's basic defense. This and the defense points of equipment
make a character's defense (DEF). The higher GRD is the better, and you will
learn that the real threat won't be physical attacks but status altering and
DEF independent offensive skills and spells. You will want to choose armor by
its special effects and not by its DEF points, so your GRD will be more
important wearing the thinner armor instead of the thicker.


Intellect

It seems to have no influence to battles, but it plays an important role in the
WRF contest. And the items added to the INT Award are truly valuable (Tiara^).


Appearence

It seems to have no influence to battles, but it plays an important role in the
WRF contest to win the APR Award. Every equippable item has APR points that can
raise your APR or even decrease it. And there can be a hidden APR bonus for the
WRF if you wear a proper equipment combination (check out the "Mini FAQ" by
Gilberto Vargas at Neoseeker.com).


Attack Power

Your STR and weapon power make your attack power (ATK). If you rely on attack
skills, the higher your ATK is the better.


Defense

Your GRD and equipment defense points make your DEF.


Maximum Hit Points

The most important parameter. High HP is solution for every problem except
death based attacks. It determines your advancement in the game with stronger
and stronger enemies. If your Max HP is lower than the damage potential of the
enemy, you should level up some more. As your Max HP gets higher, the value of
the fully healing items (WorldDew, WorldLeaf) will be more immeasurable.


Maximum Mana Points

It is important if you are all for spells. For me MP was important only in the
beginning of the adventure, when after a couple of Uppers and Heals I ran out
of mana, but later when I could use the wide variety of items and MP free
skills, MP was the last thing I looked at (I didn't look).


Experience Points

They determine your level-ups.


Weapon, Armor, Shield, Helmet, Accessory

This is when the strategy begins. You can create a "brand new" character by
equipment. Not the parameters determine your characters' worth finally, but
the equippable items, allowed to equip an item or not. Fortunately there are
great items for every character, but you won't get them in the time of need.
The greatest items are completely wasted, because they are found in the very
late of the game, where it is all the same whether you have them or not.


2.1.1. Seeds to Strengthen Your Characters

You can balance your characters' parameters by items. You can even equalize
their parameters, everybody be strong and tough enough, but this is not wise.
I usually use one or two warrior to slaughter, and the rest supports (Heal,
Bounce, Upper, TwinHits, Sap, etc.), so I give STRseeds to the warriors only.
I use AGLseeds to widen the AGL range of my party so I could count on the order
of my party's actions. DEFseed and LifeAcorn: yes, equalizing is good here, but
if you use the Guardian tactics frequently, the character that plays the
Guardian role should get the majority of these seeds. MysticNut: it depends on
your fighting style. Love offensive spells? Give the MysticNuts to the "mages".
Don't use offensive spells? Give the MysticNuts to the support. Of course
seeds are not essential, but you can imitate level-ups by them instead of
fighting monsters for EXP, especially when high Lv is bad for jobs.
These seeds raise a character's parameters permanently:
STRseed   STR    1-2
AGLseed   AGL    1-2
DEFseed   GRD    1-2
INTseed   INT    1-3
Graceherb APR    1
LifeAcorn Max HP 3-4
MysticNut Max MP 3-5


2.2. The Fight


2.2.1. Random Battles

Your party is attacked by monsters randomly in places where random battles are
available. Each step you take in the area is checked by the randomizer and may
trigger a random battle. It seems that the chance slightly raises the more
steps you have taken without an attack in an area. So it is possible to took
lots of steps in a dungeon without a random battle if you change the floors
quickly. The chances for a random battle are the best on the lands of the world
map, normal in caves and towers, and poor on the seas. Some dungeons have
floors where monsters won't attack.
 A random battle may end:
-All monsters were defeated or banished or fled.
-Your party fled.
-All your characters died (Your party was wiped out).
-All monsters were defeated and all your characters died (Sacrifice, 2EdgeHit),
 the battle will be declared as wiped out.
-You pressed O button to cancel battle (999).

Hero can NEVER die. When your party was wiped out, you lose half of the money,
but you (Hero) will be returned to the last save point.
 Random monsters have altering HP. Time Sand also sets their HP to another
random values.
 Only the random battles can be avoided some ways.


2.2.2. Special Battles

What are they?
-You start them by talking, checking or passing an invisible border.
-You can't flee (one exception).
-Some spells and skills are non-available or limited (Tamer, Chance).
-You don't get job-experience.

There are six kinds of special battles:


Trap Monsters

You opened a treasure chest, or checked or broke a pot, checked a bookcase or
looked in a well that was a monster.
-You have to defeat or banish the monster if you want him gone.
-If your party was wiped out, the monster will still be there.
-You can't use Tamer and Rib, but the monster may be tamed, though.
-You can press O button to cancel battle (999), but then this battle will be
 declared as wiped out.
-Trap monsters also drop items.


Cocoon Monsters

You ripped a monster cocoon. A single random monster will appear.
-If your party was wiped out, the monster will be gone.
-You can use Tamer and Rib, but it seems the monster can't be tamed, though.
-You can press O button to cancel battle (999).
-Cocoon monsters also drop items.


Scenario Monsters

You talk to a monster that attacks you.
-You have to defeat or banish the monster if you want him gone.
-If your party was wiped out, the monster will still be there.
-You can press O button to cancel battle (999), but then this battle will be
 declared as wiped out.
-Even though you defeated the monster it will reappear after you left the area
 and came back. Scenario monsters will disappear when the story goes on.
-Scenario monsters also drop items.


Mini Bosses

You talk to a monster that attacks you.
-You have to defeat or banish the monster if you want him gone.
-If your party was wiped out, the monster will still be there.
-Mini bosses will disappear when the story goes on.


Bosses

You fight an individual enemy.
-You have to defeat or banish the monster if you want him gone.
-If your party was wiped out, the monster will still be there.
-Bosses have to be defeated, so the story can go on.
-You may (and then always) get an item from the battle.


Invincible(?) Bosses

You fight an individual and unbeatable(?) enemy.
-Either your party was wiped out or the monsters were defeated, it won't change
 the story, the monsters will still be there or the story will go on.
-You won't lose money even if your party was wiped out.


2.3. How Is Damage Dealt?

You should reduce the enemy's Hit Points to 0 to defeat it. You can do it
various ways. Every technique has a specific damage value, and there is a
randomized range to make things less presumable.
Note: in the formulas when I use expressions like (normal+30%)-40%, I mean
(normal+normalx0.3)-(normal+normalx0.3)x0.4. For the shorter.


2.3.1. The Flag Table of Resistances

Every monster and character (and class) has resistance points for "elements",
really for almost each and every skill and spell. Resistance points can take
on only four kinds of "value" (rather a flag):
-no resistance (0),
-slight resistance (1),
-decent resistance (2),
-highest resistance or immunity (3).

I list the monster resistance flags (note that characters' resistance flags
are slightly different) and the skills/spells accordingly in the Monster List
section.


2.3.2. How Do Resistances Work?

First the target gets the specific amount of damage from an ability (force) or
the efficiency of an ability (efficiency; some abilities are 100% successful,
some are less than 50%). This value will be reduced according to the target's
resistance:

damage=force-R1

R1: resistance factor for offensive spells and the majority of skills.
    0:   0%
    1:  30%
    2:  60%
    3: 100%

damage=force-R2

R2: resistance factor for breath attacks, I mean almost all ice and fire based
    offensive skills, and for some other skills (MultiCut, BigBang, Tsunami).
    0:   0%
    1:  20%
    2:  50%
    3: 100%

damage=force-R3

R3: resistance factor for the rare ability Freeze.
    0:   0%
    1:  15%
    2:  25%
    3:  50%

damage=force-R4

R4: resistance factor for the rare ability FlameWave.
    0:   0%
    1:  10%
    2:  20%
    3:  40%

chance of success=efficiency-RC

RC: resistance factor reducing the chances of success.
    0:   0%
    1:   ?
    2:   ?
    3: 100%
I could not but estimate the chances, and that would be very hard, so I just
put ?'s. Some offensive skills also work like this (Punch, Hellblast).


2.3.2.1. Magic Defense Provided by Equipment

This is very important. The greatest threat will always be the DEF ignorant
monster abilities (breath attacks, spells, etc.), so you should choose armor
not by DEF power but "special effects". To see how MD works, I resume the
formula above:

damage=(force-R1)-MD (e.g. Blazemore)
damage=(force-MD)-R1 (e.g. Hurricane)
damage=(force-MD)-R2 (e.g. IceAir)

MD: magic defense provided by equipment. Here is an equipment list. You should
print it on a piece of paper so you can see it while playing. Even I use it
frequently, my own list...

2.3.2.1.2. Destruct Shield

DestructV adds 50 damage to almost all spells and skills (except Zap family),
however, it deals an altering additional damage of ~50 with FireSlash, for one.


2.3.2.1.3. Sorrow Shield

SorrowV takes a half from standard attack damage and shares it randomly to one
of the target's companions. It is very helpful for the wearer who can stand
higher damage than his current HP, but it raises the chances the enemy hit
and kill a character with very low HP.


2.3.2.2. EerieLite, MagicWall

Resistances can be lowered (EerieLite) or uppered (MagicWall) by 25%.
What is immune to something, that will remain immune after EerieLite.

damage=force-MW (MagicWall)
damage=force+EL (EerieLite)

MW, EL: magical effect changing resistance;

           MW1 MW2 MWC EL1 EL2 ELC
        0: 25%  0%  ?   0% N/A  ?
        1: 25% 15%  ?  25% N/A  ?
        2: 25% 20%  ?  25% N/A  ?
        3: N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A

1, 2, C: according resistance classes


2.3.2.3. Barrier, WoolGuard

You can half the damage of fire and ice based skills by the spell called
Barrier or the weapon called Hero/. WoolGuard halves ice based damage. It works
like:

damage=force-B

B: barrier effect (Barrier, WoolGuard); B=50%

Note:
-WoolGuard effect fades after ~3 turns with no text.
-Barrier effect will replace existing WoolGuard effect.
-WoolGuard effect will not replace existing Barrier effect.
-Both are useless against MegaMagic, FlameWave, and Freeze.


2.3.2.4. Final Resistance

Now the final formulas for offensive spells and skills:

damage=(((force-R1)-MW)+EL)-MD
damage=(((force-MD)-R1)-MW)+EL
damage=(((force-MD)-R2)-MW)-B

force: ranged damage potential of an ability
R1, R2: resistance factor
MD: magic defense provided by equipment
MW, EL: magical effect changing resistance;
B: barrier effect;

For example let's calculate min and max damage for IceAir for the case you are
a Diamond of the JewelBag class (slight cold resistance), you wear Heavy armor,
cast MagicWall, cast Barrier:

Min damage=
=(((50-15)-(50-15)x0.2)-((50-15)-(50-15)x0.2)x0.15)/2=
=((35-35x0.2)-(35-35x0.2)x0.15)/2=
=((35-7)-(35-7)x0.15)/2=
=(28-28x0.15)/2=
=(28-4.2)/2=
=23.8/2=
=11.9~12

Max damage=
=(((60-15)-(60-15)x0.2)-((60-15)-(60-15)x0.2)x0.15)/2=
=((45-45x0.2)-(45-45x0.2)x0.15)/2=
=((45-9)-(45-9)x0.15)/2=
=(36-36x0.15)/2=
=(36-5.4)/2=
=30.6/2=
=15.3~15


Note: BigBang is similar to breath attacks (FairWind and Barrier works, also R2
type), however, it causes damage similar to Blaze type (MD works like it was
Blaze (magic), not flame, and it seems to check for monsters' Blaze-resistance
flag, however, your characters do not resist it as Blaze type. It's very
strange, isn't it?


2.3.3. Standard Attacks

You use your strength and a weapon to deal damage to the enemy. There are some
techniques (Punch, JumpKick) that don't use weapons, but they use weapon power,
though. And, you can use every sword skill without any weapon. You can hit a
single target by using a single target skill with a multi-target weapon, and
you can hit multiple targets by using a multi-target skill with a single target
weapon either (EvilSlash with Boomerang, RainSlash with War\).
 There is no monster that immune to standard attacks (except Punch, RainSlash).
Some have high defense, though. Monsters' resistances against attacks show
dodging out of the way. Monsters that have no resistance will never dodge.
Monsters that have decent resistance will often dodge. And those that have
slight resistance (including your characters) will sometimes dodge.
 If your target's defense beats your attack power, the damage will be 1 or 0.
If it's 0, you will get the "Miss! [mr] avoided damage!" message. You may get
this same message when you have really missed the target (releasing EvilSlash,
blinded by Flash, SandStorm). The same goes with your enemy attacking you, but
then the message will be "Miss! [sy] was unharmed!".


2.3.3.1. Normal Attack

When you press "Fight", you will attack normally. The damage will be:

normal=(ATK/2-DEF/4)xP

normal: normal attack damage (later I will use this expression)
ATK: attacker's ATK (STR+WeaponPower)
DEF: target's DEF (it can be lowered or uppered by certain methods)
P: PowerUp status (1, 2, 4), it is normally 1 (it can be raised by certain
methods).

Example: your ATK is 100, monster's DEF is 100, the damage will be:
damage=(100/2-100/4)x1=(50-25)x1=(25)x1=25


2.3.3.1.1. PsycheUp, ChargeUp

Logically the attacker can double his ATK by these skills for the next turn.
But REALLY he doubles the P in the formula. What is the difference? I use the
example above:

Logically:
damage=(100x2/2-100/4)x1=(200/2-100/4)x1=(100-25)x1=(75)x1=75
This way you could have penetrated your target's DEF well.

REALLY:
damage=(100/2-100/4)x(1x2)=(50-25)x(2)=(25)x(2)=50
So there is no point in using these skills to "double ATK" by wasting a turn.

Then, what on earth are these skills are for?

Disadvantage:
-Because of the target's evasion, obviously the more attacks the more hits, so
 it is foolish to do the same damage by one attack instead of two attacks.
-Also your chances of a critical hit is halved.

Advantage:
-It's a good way of waiting until your other characters have lowered the
 target's DEF, and in the next turn you can strike on a null-defense target
 "bringing the ATK power of the previous turn with you".
-Some monsters can heal themselves. By a powered-up strike you can probably
 kill them in a single blow not giving them the opportunity to heal.
-You do slightly more damage. The bonus ranges 0..25%.


2.3.3.1.2. TwinHits

Logically the attacker can double his ATK by this spell temporalily. But REALLY
he doubles the P in the formula just like by PsycheUp, ChargeUp. TwinHits is
far more useful, though.
-It is worth wasting a turn to cast TwinHits, for it lasts for about six turns.
-TwinHits can be cast on another character, so s/he can do double damage in the
 same turn already.

What will be if you ChargeUp while TwinHits is on? The damage will be:
damage=(100/2-100/4)x(1x(2x2))=(50-25)x(1x(4))=(25)x(4)=100
If your target has higher DEF and you can only scratch it (0 or 1 damage) with
normal attack, the damage will be 0 or 4 with TwinHits+ChargeUp.

Note:
-TwinHits, ChargeUp, PsycheUp won't double the damage of a critical hit,
 EvilSlash, Massacre, Berserker, BackFlip, K.O.Punch, MetalCut and UltraHit.
-Only the first strike will be powered up for FalconCut, QuadHits, SwordDanc,
 RainSlash, Roundhous, Rip, JockDance, and attacks with multi-target weapons.
-ChargeUp, PsycheUp is pointless before Retaliate; you will attack back with
 normal power.


2.3.3.1.3. Critical Hit

You can rarely hit your target critically, when your target's DEF won't matter
and your damage potential will be equal to your ATK. The formula is simple:

damage=ATK

When may an attack be a critical hit?
-You attack normally ("Fight") AND
-you use single target weapon or bare hands AND
-you don't miss your target AND
-you don't have TwinHits on.


2.3.3.1.4. Vital Blow

There are some weapons (Dagger/, Poison/, Demon/), skills (K.O.Punch), classes
(Paladin, EvilMech) that allow you to instantly slay your target. There is no
damage. Your force will be "death".

When may an attack be a vital blow?
-You don't miss your target AND
-your target is not immune to instant kill AND
-you at least scratch your target AND
-you use standard attacks (normal attack, sword skills).


2.3.3.2. EvilSlash, Massacre

These skills allow you to hit your target critically, when your target's DEF
won't matter and your damage potential will be equal to your ATK. The formula
is simple:

damage=ATK

EvilSlash often misses, Massacre hits random target (even the attacker).


2.3.3.3. Berserker

You can deal double damage without TwinHits or ChargeUp. The formula:

damage=ATK-DEF/2

Warning: when you use this skill, you may also get double damage from enemies.

Standard attacks:

damage=(normal+S)x2

normal: normal attack damage; normal=(ATK/2-DEF/4)xP
S: skilled bonus; S=-50%..+50%
If your DEF is high and the enemy can only scratch you (0 or 1 damage), the
damage will be 0 or 2.

Note:
-When a monster use Berserker and you hit him critically, he will get double
 damage (ATKx2).
-When you use Berserker, you won't get double damage if you get hit brutally,
 just the same ATK (BrutalHit(c)). However, you get double damage from other
 similar skills (Massacre, EvilSlash, BrutalHit).

Offensive skills and spells:

damage=((forcex2)-R1)-MD
damage=((forcex2)-MD)-R2

force: ranged damage potential of an ability
R1, R2: resistance factor
MD: magic defense provided by equipment


2.3.3.4. 2EdgeHit

A strong attack with HP loss.

damage=normal+50%


2.3.3.5. Punch

A strong attack that is also resistance dependent, so it may miss sometimes.

damage=normal+50%
chance of success=100%-RC

RC: resistance factor reducing the chances of success.


2.3.3.6. Bite

It can be either a stronger or a weaker attack.

damage=normal+RG

RG: range=-25%..50%


2.3.3.7. FalconCut

It is a good skill causing same damage (hits twice) as Punch or 2EdgeHit with
no draw-backs.

damage=normal-25%

Also it doubles the chance of getting a sword effect (Dagger/, Tempt/, Deja/).


2.3.3.8. SquallHit

A quicker attack though a weaker attack:

damage=normal-25%

It's great when you want to:
-be faster than the enemy;
-"determine" the order of your party's actions.


2.3.3.9. ZombieCut, DrakSlash

You can deal bonus damage to zombies or dragons as if you attacked with Zombie/
or Dragon/:

damage=normal+50%

If you use these sword skills with Zombie/ or Dragon/, the damage will be
better than double (normal+(50%+50%)):

damage=(normal+50%)+50%

This fact makes the ZombieCut+Zombie/ and DrakSlash+Dragon/ the finest sword
techniques if you fight these types of monsters. Example (from above):

normal=(100/2-100/4)x1=25
combo damage=(25+25x0.5)+(25+25x0.5)x0.5=(37.5)+(37.5)x0.5=56.3~56

What does it mean? If you can eliminate the target's DEF (100/4) by Sap or
SickLick, you can do 25% better damage than a critical hit, and there are still
TwinHits and ChargeUp. The stairs: normal 25, single skill 37.5, combo 56.25,
with TwinHits 112.5, with TwinHits+ChargeUp 225.

Note: A critical hit attacking normally with Zombie/ or Dragon/ will not result
ATK+50% damage to undead or dragons, just the same ATK.


2.3.3.10. BirdSlash, JumpKick

You can deal bonus damage to flying monsters. The modest damage bonus of the
BirdSlash must be a mistake:

damage=normal+25%

JumpKick is better:

damage=normal+50%


2.3.3.11. MetalCut

You can deal bonus damage to metal slimes:

damage=(ATK/2-DEF/4)+50%

This skill is useless for weak characters (low STR). MetalCut begins to work
above ATK 500 (Metabble's, MetalKing's DEF: 999).


2.3.3.12. FireSlash, IceSlash, VacuSlash, BoltSlash

These skills are mixtures of normal attack and spell damage.

damage=((normal+30%)-R5)-MD

R5: resistance factor, it depends on the target's resistance.
    0:  0%
    1: 15%
    2: 40%
    3: 80%
MD: magic defense provided by equipment


2.3.3.13. QuadHits, SwordDanc

These skills hit target(s) four times.

normal-50% (QuadHits)
normal-25% (SwordDanc)


2.3.3.14. BackFlip

This skill hits all enemies.

damage=(ATK/2-DEF/4)-D

D: decrease factor determined by the number of targets;
   1: -50%
   2:   0%
   3:  25%
   4:  40%
   5:  50%
   6:  55%
   7:  61%
   8:  66%
   9:  70%
  10:  73%


2.3.3.15. RainSlash, Roundhous, Rip, JockDance

These skills hit multiple targets.

damage=normal-D
damage=(normal-D)-R1 (RainSlash)

KnockDown, LegSweep.


3. Strategic Tips


3.1. Explore The World


3.1.1. Areas

Monsters may attack your party randomly in most areas, that means battles. Each
area has a specific monster appearence, but you can also fight such monsters
that do not exist in an area normally (Help, Hatch, Merge). Of course the range
of monster species can be different, and you can also find some differences in
monster appearences in the same area. I mean, when a guide tells you that a
certain monster is found in an area and you don't find any though, you should
walk to another part of it and try there. Each area has a low-level (your party
is too weak to "rule" that land) and a job-level limit.


3.1.1.1.Terrain

For most battles terrain is just decoration, but you will fail with some skills
on water (Quake, Magma, Crack, FireTower). Perhaps the chances for an ambush by
monsters are better in mountains and forests.


3.1.2. Dungeons

They are the places where the real trials begin. Random battles of course,
traps (trap monsters, fall-downs, foul puddles), blind-ways, puzzles to solve,
and treasure to find. There are some travel spells that eases your exploration:

Smell: It tells you if there is any treasure in a location. It says unopened
chests, but it means every spot (chests, pots, barrels, on the ground, under
ground, bookcases, etc.). Note that there may be spots that Smell doesn't tell.

MapMagic: It helps you to find a hidden spot, or see if Smell included a chest
that is out of reach. It tingles and twinkles at the spot if it is on the
screen.

Location: It helps you to find your way.

TipToe: It reduces the random battle frequency, though raises the chance of an
ambush.

Repel, Repellent: When Hero's level is above the low-level of the place, you
won't be interrupted by random battles.

StepGuard: You will be able to walk through puddles, spikes, energy fields with
no harm. When you change a location StepGuard will fade.

X-Ray: It indicates the contents of a chest by showing you the "aura" of an
item; Yellow: gold, Blue: item, Red: monster, None: empty.

Slumber: Some dungeons may took long time to explore, with numerous fights that
may use up HP&MP, though you don't want to abandon the place to rest and go
through all the floors again. A character in Slumber restores HP and MP by the
steps, though s/he will start a battle sleeping. When you change a location
Slumber will be canceled, just as the sleep effect.

Antidote: Just like the item, it cures target of poison.

Outside: After you got to the end of exploration and don't want to go through
all the floors again to get out, just cast Outside.


3.1.3. Shops

Almost every town has a shop or two. And sometimes there may be "traveling
merchants" around, and they may be found in a certain part of a scenario only,
so you might miss an item that you will find much later in shops.
 Shop offers determine your success a lot. In the other hand you don't have to
buy every item just because it's better by one or two points than the old one.
First you should explore the area before shopping lest you buy an item that you
would step on the next corner.


3.1.3.1. Buy What? Buy Not

Buy:
-Equipment that has special effects. Even if it might be overshadowed by its
 ATK or DEF points in the future, it will remain useful for its special effect
 (Dagger/, Bounce/, Pixy/, ExpelV, Heavy#, EvadeT, etc.).
-Equipment that you can equip to almost every character, so even if you found
 a better stuff, another character could inherit it and use it still.
-Items that you tactically need to defeat a hard opponent.

Don't buy:
-Everything useless. I mean don't buy a thing in the idea of "It might be
 useful someday..." (Star ort, SpiderWeb, WarpWing, Boxer_, Silk^, etc.).
-Expensive stuff. There are other ways, too, to obtain items: monster drops,
 Lucky Panel.

3.1.4. The Search

Items are as inevitable in DW7 as characters, monsters, spells, and dungeons.
Most items are useless in various causes, but when I say "useless" I don't mean
that they should have been left out of the game. As far as I can tell, the most
of the items have been existing in all DQ games from the early times. They just
make you feel it better that you are playing a DQ game. And every item is kind
of decoration for the various places and scenarios. It's all the same what you
have found, the point is you have found something along your SEARCH.
 I don't list monster drops in this FAQ; I could not but copy other FAQs and
lists, for I haven't obtained items from all monsters yet. I have mentioned
items in shops and awards above, here I list items that you can find, as
treasure.

3.1.5. Casinos

Casinos eliminate money. If you are lucky, and it's easy to be lucky in a DW
Casino, you can earn so much gold that you could buy everything. And you can
play these casino games just for their sake as well.


3.1.5.1. How to Become Rich

Every casino has Lucky Panel. You can win items and some cash here. From the
items you sell you will quickly become filthy rich. And beside the money you
should play it because:
-you may win some decent equipment;
-it is an infinite source of items that are not found in shops;
-you can win some monster spirits here in case you wish to master (all) monster
 classes.

In the early casinos you can earn money from Lucky Panel even if you rotate
your cash and tokens, but you had best win lots of tokens from few cash on
other games, and put that on.

How to win thousands of tokens?

The method depends on the Casino available. In the Grand Lara Casino the Poker
Table is as good as the Slot Machines. In the Big Boss Murrel Casino and the
Coastal Casino the Slots are better because you can bet up to 500 tokens while
the Poker still has that 10 tokens top bet, which is poor.
1. Buy 100 tokens first (and save game), and play Poker at max bet. Anything
you win, double-down it. If you got 1000-2000 tokens, you can continue with the
Slots, but you can easily win 100000 at the Poker Table, even in one successful
double-down row. If you like card games like me, stay.
2. If you have a few thousands of tokens, you can milk the Slots while you are
having dinner or watching the TV. Choose a one-armed with the highest bet
and put an object on the forward button. Every now and then take a look at the
counter, if you lost the amount you may win by Metabbles or the like, just
reload the previous game, not to mention you lost all. If you won a nice sum,
save the game and continue.
 And whether puff-puff brings you good luck, I don't think so. You may catch
those 7's even without it, especially if the princess' kiss turns Slimes to
7's. I think they placed the inevitable puff-puff to the Casino because the two
things fit. By the way, getting a puff-puff massage does not take much time,
you can do it whenever you pass, and let me be mistaken and you have good luck!

3.2. Quest for All Classes

There are 54 character classes to play with. It's a great many, and it would
take some time if you wanted to master all. There isn't any sense in mastering
any class, anyway. The whole thing is for just to work on something. Some
people do not understand, and they hate DW7 for being "laborous". The game can
be finished easily with the original classes (FisherSon, WolfBoy. etc.) and
skills (HealMore, Howl, etc.), so start job-leveling only when you want the
job-leveling.
 For there is a detailed job guide by D. Short, so I just include my opinions
here.


3.2.1. Human Classes

They provide so much power (skills/spells, special abilities, bonus stats)
that you won't have any problem in battles.


3.2.1.1. Basic Classes

If you master all the basic human classes, you may as well stop, because your
party is already too strong. And they can be completed in really short time.


3.2.1.2. Advanced Classes

The most powerful skills and the finest stats are the benefits of advanced
classes, but the maturing will cost you more time. To gain access for an
advanced class, you can do two things:
-master all basic classes before monsters get quite strong and dangerous, and
 choose from all the advanced later,
-master only the required classes for an aimed advanced class and leave alone
 the rest, just to get ready for any opponent the quickest. This way you will
 miss not just the other classes, but some really great hybrid techniques.


3.2.1.3. Hybrid Skills

Almost all basic classes are connected by certain hybrid skills that you should
not let unutilized. And you don't have to do any more for them, but change
classes in the right time and the right order. It is best to level up classes
right after you free Dharma and before you go on to the next mission. This way
you can fight still not so dangerous monsters, and can change classes anytime
you wish. Later it might be impossible just to return from a captured situation
to Dharma for a hybrid skill.


3.2.1.3.1. How to Learn Hybrid Skills?

First I thought: if I use skills and spells of a certain class while I am in
another one, then I "use experience as" that class, and will learn a hybrid
technique. Not so logical. The learnig method is simply to change classes in
the right order, no matter what your character does in battles; only a dead
character does not learn anything. When you are leveling up classes you may
get a message "[sy] is becoming matured!", usually after you reach the fifth
class level. Then you should return to Dharma and change to the class from
which you expect the hybrid skill you need. Then you should level-up the other
class until you get another message that will hopefully tell you that your
character has learned the hybrid skill. The point is you always have to fight
battles for the five levels OR 30 battles if the class is above level fifth,
even mastered. Don't count the battles (30), always wait for the messages,
because you may count battles that the game doesn't (weak enemies).


3.2.1.3.2. Class Mastering Chain for All Hybrid Skills

If you want all hybrid skills for all characters, here is a guide how to make
it with minimal battles. For your characters have some hybrid skills already,
there is a different chain for each character. I leave K.O.Dance and WarCry
alone.

The guide shows class names and levels:
Change to/fight from, Fight until/change from;

and the message telling you the time to change:
BM=[sy] is becoming matured!, MU=[sy] is making up!;

and the hybrid skill learned.

3.2.2. Monster Classes

This part of the game is the land of hard workers. If you would like to watch
the many classes mastered and the many stars in your characters' info box,
then you master the monster classes. Some are very useful both in skill
repertoire both in stats and resistances. If you mastered all human classes,
you will get very few new skills, but if you haven't mastered any of them yet,
the walk of the monster paths may be more yielding. And you can skip basic
classes and change right to the super classes if you have the proper monster
hearts. And also the monster hearts are what may ruin your advancement, the
lack of them. They are rare items, some are found in chests, some can be won on
Lucky Panel, but the ones that only monsters drop (rather they won't drop for
Christ's sake) are the hardest to get.


3.2.2.1. Basic Classes

They require a monster spirit (heart) to change classes. Put the monster
heart in your character's inventory, and talk to the high priest of Dharma to
change classes. Once you obtained a monster class, you won't need further
hearts to change back to that class any more. However, you need a heart for
each character, and to find five hearts each for the 14 basic monster classes
is a great achievement. First collect the ones from chests, then play Lucky
Panel for the others. Some people hate Lucky Panel, but I think you get the
hearts faster that way than from battles. And for the rest you have to fight
battles. I list the basic classes by the heart availablity:

Class     Heart Found

Slime     chest (1), Lucky Panel, droppped
Lipsy     chest (2), dropped
Healer    chest (1), dropped
Florajay  chest (1), dropped
Hork      chest (1), dropped
Wyvern    chest (2), Lucky Panel, dropped
BoltRat   dropped
EvlTurtle chest (1), Lucky Panel, dropped
Dumbira   dropped
Berserker chest (1), Lucky Panel, dropped
JewelBag  dropped
LizardMan dropped
Bombcrag  Lucky Panel, dropped
Mimic     chest (1), Lucky Panel, dropped


3.2.2.2. Advanced Classes

The quickest way to access advanced monster classes is master the required
basic classes. When I want to master these, I never care about the hearts, just
complete the basics, because:
-the dropping ratio is so low that you may as well master the required basic
 classes while trying to get the (five) heart(s);
-the monsters the advanced monster classes are originated from are found in the
 very late of the game (Esterk, PlatKing). The last basic monster is LizardMan
 in the Great Lighthouse (present), so it is possible to master ALL the 54
 classes on disk one.


3.2.3. Mastering Classes for The Earliest

If you haven't done too much level-up until Dharma and your characters are at
Lv 10-15, you can master all human classes and some monster classes, too, that
are accessable by the available hearts (Casino) before the next mission.
What to do?:
-Fight monsters of the lowest EXP; the farther you go back to previous missions
 the lowest EXP you earn (generally).
-Fight in areas where you still get job-levels, and move on only when the
 highest Lv character levels up and earns no more job-level points.
-Kill only one monster per battle, the one of the lowest EXP.
-Make use of the Help ability: for example Meranza (19 EXP) calls Eggplaton
 (3 EXP) in, kill Eggplaton and banish Meranza.
-There are some bosses (high EXP) that can be banished or tricked to leave the
 scene (Bandit, Pigmon, ColumnMan, SeaGrudge, Babygoyle, TreeGuard).


3.2.3.1. KnockDown, Expel Shield, Expel, Disperse

By these abilities and item you are able to keep EXP and Lv low.
-KnockDown is the skill of the Thief class. It removes a single monster from
 battle. It costs no MP, and it's 100% successful with monsters of no
 resistance.
-Expel is a spell of the Cleric class. It may remove a group of monsters from
 battle. It only costs 1 MP, but you run out of MP very quickly, though,
 because it fails with monsters of even no resistance half the time, and there
 is OddDance (MudDoll, ColumnMan, TrickBag) that makes MP reduction faster.
 You learn Expel after the first battle as Cleric.
-Disperse is a spell of the Ranger class. It costs 8 MP (why so much?) and
 may remove a single target from battle. I never use it. It is equal to Expel
 regarding to resistances.
-The Expel shield can be bought at Gorges. It removes a group of monsters from
 battle when used just like Expel, but regarding to resistances, it is equal to
 KnockDown, though, (very interesting), and 100% successful with monsters of no
 resistance.

See Monster List which banishing methods you should use. You may also confuse
a monster, and a confused monster may leave the scene.


3.2.4. Some Areas and Dungeons with Level Limits for Job Level-up

Here is a list for some places with Lv limits, right before one of your heroes
levels up, you should move on because there will be no more maturing:

3.3. Walkthrough with Essential Classes

As I said before, you don't really need any class, but to complete some side
quests, some classes can be very helpful, and if you don't like some nasty
bosses dusting your clothes too many times, you can strengthen your party by
some useful skills.


3.3.1. Essential Classes

I understand those who don't want to waste precious time on leveling up classes
and are also sick of such "boring" things. So here is some classes of which
mastering aren't so painful and provide some individually useful skills.


3.3.1.1. Shepherd

Antidote:
With this spell you don't need to carry Antidotes any more. Against PoisonFog
it's very handy.

Slumber:
You can restore MP and HP by walking.

Whistle:
You can start a battle instantly for level-ups, monsters, drops; you don't have
to walk around your lifetime to trigger a random battle (especially on seas).

WoolGuard:
It halves cold-breath damage for ~3 turns.

Stampede:
It fails sometimes, but there aren't many monsters that can stand its decent
level dependent and DEF ignorant damage.

Mineuchi:
A hybrid skill with the Warrior class. Very useful against PaniDance, PanicAll,
Sleep, SleepAir, etc.


3.3.1.2. Thief

Location:
It helps you find your way in dungeons.

Smell:
It eases the search for treasure.

Steal:
You can obtain items in battles with more probablity.


3.3.1.3. Tamer

Tamer:
This skill makes the monster hunt for the Park faster, much faster.

Item Use:
You can't use Rib sucessfully if your character has never been a Tamer**.


3.3.1.4. TeenIdol

Ironize:
The safest defense. Combine it with Sacred# and you can get out from narrow
situations.

Hustle:
It's almost a cheat. It heals everybody without items and MP.

BackFlip:
A fine attack skill. For the strong characters it's useful.

FireTower:
It fails sometimes, but causes great damage. Bosses go down quickly by this.

LifeSong:
It's always good to have a revival method in your hands.

Well it's 921 battles (Shepherd 135, Warrior 55 (for Mineuchi), Thief 140,
Tamer 18 (for Item Use), TeenIdol 180+120(Dancer)+140(Bard)+133(Jester)) and
you can kill&heal with ease, and complete the monster park if you wish.


3.4. Classless Games

A Classless game does not allow you to use the Dharma class (job) system, just
to leave your characters in their original strength (stats and skills), so you
can find more challenge in battles and you should be more passionate along your
search for items.


3.4.1. The Best Way to Play!

If you want to enjoy DW7, play it Classless. The game will have the challenge
until the end, and except the monster park there will be nothing disadvantage.
With proper level-up you can defeat all bosses (even that certain one in 19).
What's the use of devastating all opponents with those super strong new
techniques (UltraHit, GigaSlash, WhiteAir, HellFlame, etc.) they put in this
volume of the series? And healing your party without MP loss (Hustle)?
ZombieCut, Sap, Upper, ParryPass, Sleep, HealMore; these make a DW game for me.


3.4.2. Items vs. Skills&Spells

I don't know if it was intentional or by a mistake, using items provide you
much more advantage than the suitable spells or skills, so there is sense in
keeping certain items in inventory. Here is a table that shows you the
differences in the "same" effect methods. Some of them may be an advantage one
time and a disadvantage in the other.

The Disadvantage Flags:

SS: StopSpell; you can't use the technique when you are sealed by StopSpell.
EF: EerieFog; you can't use the technique when you are sealed by EerieFog or
    Gigastis.
BC: BounCe; your cast spell will be returned to you because of target's Bounce,
    BounceOn or MagicBack.
FW: FairWind; your breath attack will be returned because of target's FairWind.
RT: Retaliate; Target can copy the technique.
MP: The technique uses MP.
WT: WasTed; you lose MP even if your spell won't take effect.
ML: May Lose; you may lose the item by the use.
OU: One-Use item; you will lose the item by the use.
OO: One-use Only-when; you will lose the item only when it takes effect.
UI: Unique Item;
NI: No Initiative;
SF: SelF; the technique can be used on self only.
GR: GuaRdian; when you use the technique the target will always be the
    Guardian or Scapegoat of the user.
EO: Effect is On already; the game doesn't allow you to use the technique on a
    target that already has the complete effect.
TR: TRavel; you cannot use technique beside battles.
TN: TerraiN; you cannot use technique on water.

3.4.3. Weapon Effects

Some weapons can do something more beside damage, so this can be more an
option than ATK power when shopping. And if you play DW7 Classless, you will
get some "sword skills" for your modest skill/spell arsenal.


3.4.3.1. Additional Damage

These weapons do elemental damage to the target or another target additionally:

        Casts:     Hits (element type):
FlameW  Blazemore  Firebal
IceW    SnowStorm  IceBolt
Flame/  Bang       Blaze
Oceano/ TwinHits   Zap
Snow/   N/A        IceBolt

The additional damage will be (attacker must hit target normally before):

damage=((ATK/2-DEF/4)/2)-R1

Here are some examples to show how the FlameW works in cases when the first
target (T1) dies due to the normal attack damage and another target (T2) gets
the additional damage:
                 1A  1B  1C  2A  2B  3A  3B  4A  4B  5   6   7   8A  8B

   Damage to T1   0   1  25  25  25  50  25   -  25 100 200  32   6  19
       T2's DEF 100 100 200 100 100 100   0 100 100 100 100 100 100 100
 T2 Resists Sap   0   0   0   0   0   3   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
    and Firebal   0   0   0   0   2   0   3   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
   T2's Evasion   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   3   0   0   0   0   0
   Damage to T2   -  12   0  12   5  12   0   -  12  12  12  12  12  12
     Sum damage   0  13  25  37  30  62  25   0  37 112 212  44  18  31

1: Sometimes the additional damage may be higher than the normal damage(B),
   or 0 (C), or take no effect at all (A).
2: You should care about the targets' resistances.
3: When Sap helps (A), and when it doesn't (B).
4: It seems additional damage cannot be dodged, so care about the targets'
   evasion. 
5: A critical hit makes no difference.
6: TwinHits+ChargeUp makes no difference.
7: Sword skills (FireSlash) make no difference.
8: Sword skills (FireSlash(A), SquallHit(B)) make no difference.


3.4.3.2. Falcon Cut

The Falcon/ imitates FalconCut, however, a hit of FalconCut will never be
a critical hit, but a hit of the Falcon/ will. There is a similar weapon called
Needle/, though it "only" strikes twice per attack.


3.4.3.3. Vital Blow

Dagger/, Poison/, Demon/ may instantly slay target if it isn't immune to death.
They are excellent used with skills like QuadHits, RainSlash, FalconCut,
Retaliate, etc.


3.4.3.4. Critical or Nothing

Demon\ and Demon) are effective weapons against extremely high DEF monsters.
They miss often, but they will always hit critically. When you play DW7
Classless, they will be your EvilSlash. When you use them with sword skills,
you will often miss your target, but you won't lay a Critical-FireSlash, for
one, just the same FireSlash.


3.4.3.4.1. Demon Hammer and Devil Sword

This must be a mistake:
Item          Special Effect          Info Box            Removeable
Demon Hammer  Critical or Nothing     Slow but hits hard  No
Demon Axe     Critical or Nothing     Slow but hits hard  Yes
Devil Sword   Paralyzes User Often    Smell trouble       Yes
Devil Armor   Paralyzes Wearer Often  Smell trouble       No

Devil/ should have been cursed instead of Demon\. Devil and demon are synonyms,
maybe that's why they mistook these two weapons. What a pity.


3.4.3.5. Miracle

It is the best sword effect of all. The more powerful hits you lay, the more
you heal yourself, because you restore HP by the 1/4 of the damage you deal.
If you wear Sacred#, you will be almost invincible. You must esteem that few
Miracle/ you obtain.


3.4.3.6. Dual-edge

You take 1/6 damage from the damage you deal.


3.4.3.7. Bad Status

Each of these weapons may cause a bad status to the target if it isn't immune:
Weapon:  Effect:
Bug/     Paralyze
MonsterW Paralyze
Tempt/   Sleep
Seduce/  Confuse
DevilW   Deadly Poison
This is not a great deal, but as you cause damage and may disable your target
at the same time; little fragments of advantages lead you to victory or help
you out of trouble. My favorite is the DevilW. It has good ATK, and its poison
finishes everything in some turn even while your entire party is disabled. At
low levels it is very useful against the first DorasBoxes you meet.

3.4.4. More WorldDew

You will probably need better healing methods than HealMore or SageRock when
you play the game Classless. WorldDew is great, but the Krage shop sells only
one per customer. You can outfox them, though.
1. Enter the shop, and buy a WorldDew.
2. Leave the shop, and put the WD into a companion's inventory.
3. Enter the shop again, and buy another WD.
4. Repeat the #2 and #3 until they announce the stock out or your companions'
   inventories are full of WD.
When the shop has no more WD, leave Krage, and return, maybe it will help. You
can even max out your WD supply (3 companions x 12 inventory slots + you = 37),
that will be enough.


4. Tactical Tips


4.1. Make Your Plan

When you are about to face a challenging adversary, or the opposite case, you
wish to finish random battles quickly, you should make a plan for the battle,
and do some preparations, because once a battle has begun you won't be able to
rummage in the Bag for an item or exchange items between your characters. You
must decide who will do what before the battle.


4.1.1. First of All Change Your Party to "Manual"

Your characters are set to A.I. by default, so "change" them to Manual
immediately, because A.I. doesn't:
-care about which monster you want to defeat last for a drop or taming.
-use even the infinite items like Bless/, SageRock, FlameW, Pixy/, etc.
-use some useful skills (Howl, FireTower).
-care about what you plan to do in a turn; this is when two characters (Hero
 and another controled by A.I.) heal the same character, or none because you
 expect A.I. to have a character heal the wounded but it doesn't, and the low
 HP one will die.
-absolutely fit some real advanced tactics.


4.1.2. Reorder Your Party

The first character is attacked more times than the others, and the last one is
left alone more times, and some skills of decreasing damage hit the fore of
your party harder, so reorder it as your characters' HP, DEF fit the threat.


4.1.3. Equip Your Party

Equipment is a leading part in DW7. You can change weapon and armor even in
battles, and you should sometimes. Don't forget that equipment "works on along"
even when your character is disabled (Sleep, Confuse); the healing armor called
Sacred# is a trump card; the Mirror# deflecting spells kills the enemy while
you are wetting your pants; and never try to substitute MD armor and shields
with MagicWall, Barrier or FairWind, they will let you down when you need
protection the most. Weapons are not so important, especially if you aren't a
warrior type.


4.1.4. Offense and Support

Give your characters roles that fit them. In difficult battles some characters
should support the others who work on defeating the enemy. In the other hand,
there may be some situations where everyone is both a healer and attacker,
their actions depend on who are under your control or how HP of your party is
doing.


4.2. Offensive Tactics


4.2.1. Agile and Annihilating

Sometimes random monsters are worse than bosses because of their bad status
tricks. The best way to prevent them is quickly and powerfully get rid of them.
Level-ups always help you to be faster (AGL) and strong enough, but probably
you don't want to hoe weak monsters all day long. I like AGL Scarf very much,
and although there will be better accessories than that, in the beginning it
helps a lot to strike first. Also you can change to an agile class, but I think
you will change classes to master them in that part of the adventure. Gabo is
already an agile little beast, so train him to classes that have powerful
all-target spells and skills as a good strategy. He has modest MP, so some
MysticNuts can make him a useful spellcaster.
 Breath attacks are very good. They are all-target skills and don't use MP, and
most monsters are weak to fire or cold. I like Vacuum, too; it's powerful, and
plays less animation.
 Later in the game it won't be easy to be annihilating, because monsters have
better resistances, so you should know their weaknesses and the potential of
your arsenal. This is why I am rather a warrior type gamer, and sometimes it's
even better to attack normally than to throw the most powerful "hellish" stuff
into the air.


4.2.2. All Targets vs. Single Target

Although all-target techniques have the best damage potential, I prefer single-
target skills because all-target techniques "don't sort" monsters by item drops
or taming. All-target techniques are also bad for job-leveling, they would kill
a lot.


4.2.3. Save MP

I don't see why still there are spells in this game. Or why they put skills in
that use no MP and are even more powerful than spells. And there are some fine
items (FlameW, Thunder/, Lava/) to defeat monsters without MP while you still
have few skills in the beginning of the class evolution.
 When you explore an unknown dungeon, and probably there will be something
challenging in its end, you'd better use standard attack techniques even if
battles will last longer for this reason, and use the infinite-healing items
in battles to heal, or Herbs after battles. Sometimes I start a random battle
just to get everybody to full-HP before a boss.


4.2.4. Prepare for Offense


4.2.4.1. Sap, Defense

For the serial monsters it's just a waste of time to reduce defense, but when
you fight an individual opponent, its high HP declares a long battle and takes
numerous attacks to kill, so if it isn't immune to Sap, you should always
reduce its defense to raise your offensive potential. Sap lasts for five or six
turns, or I should say "actions of the target" rather, because if your enemy
has two or more actions per turn, the effect will fade in fewer turns.
 If your target's DEF is odd, for example it is 55, Sap will reduce it by
halves, 22 and 22, and there will be 1 left, but after five turns you should
reduce that 1, too. This way you will get another five turns with 0 DEF of your
target instead of two Saps to reduce that two 22 again.
 I almost never use Defense. However, Defense is a useful weapon in the hands
of your enemy, against your party Defense works well. So it is worth your
efforts to prepare for it (Bounce, MagicBack) and return it to the caster, this
way you will protect your party and weaken the enemy at the same time.


4.2.4.2. TwinHits, ChargeUp, PsycheUp

TwinHits is very useful if you like sword techniques. ChargeUp and PsycheUp is
good if you use Sap (see Damage Dealt - Normal Attack).


4.2.4.3. EerieLite

You can reduce the resistances of the enemy with this skill, but I don't
recommend it, because:
-It doesn't affect immunities.
-It makes no difference with no-resistances.
-Monsters may be resistant or immune to EerieLite as well.
So you had better use those spells to attack that your target is weak to.


4.3. Defensive Tactics

The most amusing part of a boss-battle is staying alive, isn't it? It requires
wits to formulate tactics to be able to stand the enemy's attempts to kill you.


4.3.1. Parry, StrongD

When a character is parrying it will half almost all kind of damage. It's good
to tire the enemy out (it runs out of MP), or when you know the enemy is about
to come with its most powerful offense, it may even save your life.
 And having one or two characters parry all the time will theoretically double
your HP or rather half the enemy's offensive potential. If it is hitting the
parrying ones while you attack with the other characters, you will have to heal
less times.
 And it reduces the chances the enemy attack fatally a character; I mean, for
example your party HP are around 100, and the enemy has a strong skill or spell
to deal more damage than 100 (BrutalHit, two attacks per turn, Blazemost,
Spike, FireTower, etc.) it will be 100% to kill someone normally, but if the
half of your party is parrying, it will be 50%. Remember it is very bad to let
a character die; even in the best case two characters will waste a turn (the
dead one and the resurrecter one).
 StrongD is a very useful skill for the "parry tactics", it reduces damage to
10%. StrongD can be also a lifesaver if your HP has gotten very low. It's very
good against BrutalHit(c), spells, but useless against breath attacks, so I
don't recommend it for the most cases.


4.3.2. Evasion

To increase evasion is my favorite defensive tactics because I can both defend
myself and attack though it's risky, for you get no damage or 100%, but I think
one can gain advantage from one's good luck only. You can't beat an extremely
strong opponent while you are extremely weak, but with good luck. And evasion
is all about good luck.
 I said "tactics" though it is a matter of equipment. You should replace your
thickest and magically wonderous wear to dodge armor (EvadeT, Dance#, DarkT and
maybe WindT). I highly recommend it when your party is targeted by SleepAir,
PalsyAir, SandStorm, CragThrow, BrutalHit(c), and for a Guardian it's almost a
necessity against these attacks.
 I don't see the point in the use of SideStep. Also there are classes that have
better evasion (Dancer), but their having worse stats is disadvantage in the
end.


4.3.3. ParryPass

This tactics is similar to evasion being risky. ParryPass passes standard
attacks to other targets (it might be both enemy and companion). It is very
effective when you are outnumbered. And if your enemy is much stronger than
you, you had best use its own power to defeat itself while you get no harm at
all. Combine it with evasion, so, even if you fail to parry, you might still
dodge the attack. And ParryPass doubles evasion! I noticed that the game checks
for evasion before ParryPass and after a casual failure, too. However, you will
be vulnerable against spells, breath attacks, and many more threats, and for
example and for your note, a BrutalHit cannot be parry-passed. And you cannot
double-parrypass an attack, I mean, when your character passes an attack to
another that also does ParryPass, s/he will be hit.


4.3.4. Guardian

This defensive tactics has the most impact to your success. You sacrifice a
character to get the damage for the others, therefore you do not reduce damage,
and you risk a character's life, so what's the use?
-A Guardian may protect characters of very low HP to save them from certain
 death.
-You can utilize the defenses of a unique armor or a very expensive armor, or
 armor that you cannot equip to everyone.
-You can utilize a character's better parameters (HP, DEF, resistances).
-You foreknow who will be attacked and who you will have to heal.
-You can save your party from bad statuses that have less impact to the
 Guardian (Flash, SandStorm, Surround, StopSpell, PoisonGas, PoisonFog,
 DeMagic)
-You don't need to support all characters with defenses (Upper, Bounce) but the
 Guardian.

Scapegoat is similar to the Guardian, but the latter has higher priority. Here
is a table to see how these skills "collect" damage:

G: Guardian character, S: Scapegoat character, T: Target character, O: Others.

Your party   Who will be hit?
1  2  3  4
O  O  O  T   4
G  O  O  T   1
S4 O  O  T   1
G  G  O  T   1 or 2
G  G  G  G   1 or 2 or 3 or 4
G  S1 O  T   1
S4 S1 O  T   1
S4 S4 O  T   1 or 2


4.3.5. The Defense Bonus (Upper, Increase)

You have the Guard (GRD) parameter for basic defense, and equipment adds to
this and makes your Defense (DEF). And there is Battle Defense (BDEF) as I call
it. Normal BDEF=DEF, Max BDEF=DEF+200, Min BDEF=0. Battle Defense can be raised
by DEF/2 (Upper) or DEF/4 (Increase, WarSong) up to DEF+200, and it can be
reduced to 0 (SickLick) or reduced by DEF/2 (Sap) or DEF/4 (Defense) down to 0.
 When you use Upper, you will give a character a defense bonus that can greatly
help you to stay alive. For example, you have DEF=10, with Uppers you can get
even BDEF=210 for defense, it is a great difference.
 As you have better GRD and thicker armor (I mean armor that adds more to DEF),
Increase will get more effective than Upper. For example your party's average
DEF is 800, Upper and Increase will give you the same +200, but Increase will
do it for all of you by a single cast, Upper will do it by four casts, though
it's an extreme case. A +100 DEF bonus is enough usually, and with 200 DEF for
average defense in your party, Upper will do it by four uses, and Increase will
do it by two uses.
 The defense bonus not just makes your characters tougher, but you don't have
to buy the best armor of high cost, or you can utilize an item that, although
it provides modest DEF naturally, has an useful special effect (EvadeT, MagicT,
AGL Scarf, ValiantO, etc.).
Note: Monsters' Max BDEF=DEFx2.


4.3.6. Ironize

The absolute defense. However, DeMagic dispells it. Ironize is useful when you
foreknow the enemy's next action and want to avoid it. It also helps you learn
about monsters' abilities you have first met. If you are a patient kind, you
can have monsters waste their strong spells and MP, and attack when it's safe.


4.3.7. Defeat the Enemy by Its Own Force

There is nothing more amusing than to watch how your enemy hurts itself. My
favorite is Bounce, of course when the enemy has spells. Bounce can be put on
by the spell (Bounce) or the Bounce/, and it lasts for six turns or rather six
actions of your characters, because if you "talk" all the time, Bounce won't
fade. I like to combine it with Guardian.
 MagicBack is not so good as Bounce, because it will be on just for the current
turn and you really do nothing, but it is cast preceding normal actions.
 You should also be careful, because your support spells (HealMore, Upper,
Revive (Mirror#, LightT)) will be reflected as well, so you should use other
ways to do them (Sage/, Pixy/, WorldLeaf).
 FairWind can return a breath attack to the attacker and will fade. It lasts
for about six turns.
 Even if your attacker is immune to its own weapons, you should still protect
yourself fully by these techniques.


4.4. Disable the Enemy

Get rid of enemy attacks and abilities if you want a safer battle. Sometimes
even the strongests of your enemies can be easily beaten if you find a way to
disable them.


4.4.1. Bark, BoxerDanc

In random battles you may find yourselves outnumbered often. Tie down enemy
groups even if it takes a character or two to do that, and slowly but without
a scratch you can defeat them. Gabo's Bark works well early on when you have
poor funds to buy proper equipment.
 When you fight a strong opponent, tie him down at all costs, if you can, to
avoid his attacks or dangerous status-tricks. Bark, BoxerDanc makes an enemy
group lose a turn or rather an action. If target has two actions per turn, it
will lose only one and will be able to act in the same turn. If target has
already acted when you stun it, it will be inactive in the next turn.


4.4.2 Sleep

Maribel's Sleep is very useful, it has affection on some bosses, too, and you
can disable your opponent for a couple of turns instead for only one turn. And
when you use this nice tactics, you should use spells, items, or skills that
don't wake up target instead of attacks.


4.4.3. StopSpell

Some spells can be very dangerous, so try to seal them if you can. You will
get two advantages:
-You get rid of a threat.
-The enemy may lose a turn trying to cast a spell.


4.4.4. DanceShut

There are some abilities that can be sealed just like spells. Dances can be
just annoying (OddDance, RobDance, LureDance) and even dangerous (PaniDance,
SwordDanc, K.O.Dance), so try to seal them if you can. You will get two
advantages:
-You get rid of a threat.
-The enemy may lose a turn trying to dance.


4.5. Notes for Some Skills


4.5.1. Retaliate

Maribel's Retaliate can be very effective, of course it may be absolutely
useless if she isn't the one who gets the attacks, or she is attacked by such
abilities that can't be copied (see Monster Abilities).
 Although she isn't a great fighter, she can deal decent damage with the proper
weapons:
-Equip her with a whip, and she will attack an enemy group as many times as she
 gets an attack from that group.
-Equip her with a weapon that deals additional effects (Dagger/, Bug/, Seduce/)
 and watch what will happen when she gets a hit from RainSlash, SwordDanc,
 QuadHits.
-BackFlip is used often by monsters, and although Maribel won't deal serious
 damage, she will always get a hit from this all-target skill and srtike back.
-If you fight monsters with the ChargeAll ability, equip Maribel with the
 Needle/. She will beat down the whole enemy party two times at 50% power.
 With a normal weapon (LuneY) she will do it only once. If she uses a whip
 or the like (SunY), she will deal a decreasing damage from 50% to the group
 only, from where she get the attack. See the difference?

Retaliate is also good when the user have only few skills to choose from, and
they deal modest damage, and the opponent has strong offensive skills that are
worth to copy. The best skills to copy are the all-target ones, from which
Maribel gets only one amount, but she deals back to all, and everytime. For
example, she gets a hit from Lightning and luckily she wears SkirtT and MagicV,
she will be unaffected and will retaliate, and maybe she gets another and
another, and the monsters (six Thunderats) are defeated in one turn by one
character!
 What if the opponent has two actions per turn? She will copy only the last
copiable attack.
 Retaliate does not use MP, so it is a good way to spare MP, or in the opposite
case, when Maribel runs out of MP, she still can copy enemy spells.


4.5.2. SickLick

It reduces target's DEF to 0 and stun it without MP use, so it can replace
Sap very well, though it fails sometimes even if target's resistance 0.
However, the point isn't that! SickLick checks for the DEF-down resistance flag
just like Sap, Defense, and almost all bosses aren't immune to Sap, so you can
make them lose a turn by SickLick even if they are immune to Bark, BoxerDanc,
etc. You will beat them hands down...


4.5.3. Majustis, Gigastis, DeMagic, EerieFog

Majustis deletes some spell effects, but oddly enough it doesn't delete
TwinHits while you have tested it on a certain someone, haven't you?
Gigastis deletes some effects (Upper and Sap as well) on target, and dissipates
all spells cast by EVERYONE for two turns beside the current one. Well, the
Ultimate Magic is rather DeMagic, it deletes even EerieFog, it uses no MP, and
all characters can learn it. EerieFog also makes effects fade and dissipates
all spells cast by everyone, and it lasts till the end of battle. It's very
useful against death magic, powerful offensive spells, and enemy can't heal
itself with spells. And you should use Hustle to heal, and items to support
(Lune/, Godeus/, Oceano/, Sleep/) and skills and items to attack (Howl,
Thunder/, FlameW, etc.). Here is a table how effective these techniques are:

M=Majustis
G=Gigastis
D=DeMagic
E=EerieFog

Effect    M G D E
Upper     Y Y Y Y
Sap       Y Y Y Y
TwinHits  N Y Y Y
Bounce    N Y Y Y
MagicWall N N Y Y
EerieLite N N Y Y

Transform Y Y Y Y
Change    Y Y Y Y
BeDragon  Y Y Y Y
Surround  N N Y Y
SandStorm N N N N
StopSpell N N Y Y
DanceShut N N N N


4.5.4. Summon, Summoner

They are very useful, especially in boss battles. A summoned one:
-supports your party (HealMore, WarSong, etc.);
-may take damage and bad status instead of your characters;
-helps to deal damage to the enemy.
However, I don't need help, I like to win on my own, I didn't like the
auxiliary characters in my party as well. It's not my style, though you may
like it. Even the weakest summon is worth a turn and MP of a character. Use it
and you will win. They and their stats are listed in the Monster List section.


4.6. Boss Battles


4.6.1. How to Beat Them

These individual opponents make gameplay better, their challenge is the fun.
Some of them may be annoyingly "evil" because they don't want to die as easily
as some players wish. Generally you can do some things that work in almost all
boss-battles:
-Level-up, and you will be strong enough to beat the enemy.
-Give characters the best equipment you can get, such equipment that will fit
 the threats.
-Give characters items for the worst cases (WorldLeaf, WorldDew).
-Start the battle at full HP and MP.
-Raise your characters' defenses (Upper).
-Put Bounce on if your opponent has especially offensive spells.
-Put Barrier or/and FairWind on if your opponent has breath attacks.
-Don't attack with every character, some characters do best when they are
 protecting themselves (who don't have proper equipment or/and who can deal but
 modest damage to the enemy).
-Raise your offensive potential by TwinHits and Sap.
-Don't try bad-status tricks (PanicAll, Sleep, PoisonFog, PalsyAir, etc.) or
 fast ways to win (Beat, Ramming, KnockDown, Expel, etc.), because they won't
 work usually, but if some of them do though, you can gain great advantage.
-Heal yourselves with MP free techniques (Bless/, SageRock, Hustle, Meditate)
 so you can attack with the most powerful skills that usually use lots of MP.
-Change text rotation to 8 (keypressed), so you can see damage and effects
 better. It will help if you keep a "log" for effects (Bounce, Upper, Barrier,
 TwinHits, etc.) and schedule your actions so.


4.6.1.1. My Randomless Quest (Kind of Boss FAQ)

I made a battle log for my Randomless quest. You play DW7 Randomless if you
never fight random enemies to level-up and for gold. 
 It contains every no-random battle along my quest, so the boss-battles as
well. So you can find almost all the bosses and their fall in it, and it's a
great spoiler by its very nature. You may get more info and tactical hints from
it than this FAQ. It's also a strategy guide to beat the game with so limited
money. You may get an idea from my battles how strong your party is, whether
you will be able to defeat a boss. You can formulate better tactics to beat an
enemy by analizing my mistakes. And it is also a "novel" to read.


4.6.2. Invincible(?) Bosses

In DW7 there are a few individual bosses, that look unbeatable, even the FAQs
and guides tell the regular player not to fight, just let your party die. But
who wants to die? Not me. I spent "some" time trying to defeat them, and I was
successful. So there are no invincible opponents in this game. That's a fact
now.
 I made a log fighting these enemies to show you they can be beaten, how much
you should prepare, and make you feel their toughness (incredible long battles)
and strength. And weakness.


4.6.3. To Read the Two Battle Logs

Both Randomless and Invicible(?) Bosses give you many an example for what I
stated and explained in this FAQ. If you are patient then you can ask me
through e-mail (cborjati@gmail.com) to send the battle logs or maybe you can
download them from the post #5 at this link:
http://www.woodus.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6912&hl=webmaster
It seems you no longer can download the files without an user account there.


4.7. Obtaining Items from Battles

Everybody likes to get items from monsters:
-Items from monsters are free, however, maybe this is the most expensive way
 to get an item (time is money).
-Some items cannot be bought in shops, and some can even be obtained from
 monsters only.

Every monster drops only one specific item. Most items are useless. The most
useful drops are the seeds. I, for one, always kill that monster last which
drops a seed. Only the last defeated monster may drop an item, and how many
turns were gone by or how many monsters fled or were banished after the last
killed one that does not matter.
 The items in boss battles are exceptional. You always obtain the item, but it
can be dropped by any of the monsters if it is not one opponent. Maybe this is
why you cannot banish or confuse most bosses; how could you get a Shard if the
boss is gone?


4.7.1. Dropping Ratio

Every monster drops an item determined by a race specific ratio. For example
Centbeast drops an item often. Healer drops an item very rarely (you can easily
defeat the 999 without a lousy item). The randomozer is god in this game. You
may get the item from the first Healer you defeat, and of course you may never
get any. The worst chance of dropping is 1:500 as far as I can estimate it. And
500 means 500 battles in which that monster was killed last.


4.7.2. Monster Spirits (Hearts) from Battles

Getting a monster heart from battles is the most disputed part of DW7. Many
people complain about it. If you don't want the vast amounts of battles for
a heart then don't do that. This, with the job evolution and the monster park
task, is for the mere time killing. It's a hard core thing. A test for your
patience. What would be the use of every monster dropping a heart? You should
work for it, that is the point.
 How could you raise your chances of getting a heart, though? I tell you what I
do to get a heart (or a very needed item) in battles, but I am not telling that
I am completely right, but it seems to work for me:
-When you are on the hunt for a monster heart, DON'T defeat other monsters if
 the wanted monster isn't among the opponents, flee instead. If you fight only
 Dubira-battles (Dumbira was killed last), you cannot get but Dumbira hearts or
 Copper/s. If you fought various-monster-battles, then you might easily get a
 lot of various and useless items and no Dumbira heart.
-While you are on the hunt for monster hearts, you probably go for the jobs.
 Defeat one monster, the one that may drop the heart, and banish the rest. If
 you defeated all appearing enemy, your EXP and Lv would get so high that you
 would not get job-levels in that area before you got the five hearts for your
 characters.

Again:
-Do you need the useless items that other monsters would drop? No.
 (If 100 different monsters drop an item, it's 1% to be a certain item. If 100
 monsters of the same kind drop an item, it's 100% to be a certain item.)
-Do you need the EXP that you would earn defeating other monsters? No.
 (EXP is bad for jobs; You've got the MetalKings to earn good EXP after all.)
-Do you need the poor gold that you would earn defeating other monsters? No.
 (You've got the Casinos to earn good money.)
-You need the monster heart.
-You need one single monster defeated for the job-levels.

So flee or banish them. Fleeing is the quickest way to end a battle and get rid
of monsters you don't want to defeat.
(I keep an item drop log along my AllClasses quest. For example I got five
hearts and six Copper/s from 459 Dumbira-battles, and five hearts and a Steel/
from 62 LizardMan-battles. It's not so bad.)

-The heart dropping ratio is not the same as the item dropping ratio of the
 monster. It can be much better (Healer) or also worse (Rosevine) (but I didn't
 tested the latter, and I won't).
-You seem to be unable to steal a monster heart.
-You should not go for the hearts of advanced classes, it's shorter to access
 them from the basic classes.
-Monsters start dropping hearts after the monster man has given you the
 BeefJerky, but you don't have to tame the monster or fill up Monster Houses to
 get its heart, the two things are different though they are triggered by the
 same event. And there is a special case of getting hearts right after Dharma,
 but shortly it is switched off I can't guess why.


4.7.3. Thieving Methods

Waiting for a monster to drop an item can be frustrating. If you want an item
badly from a monster, you should do something about it:


4.7.3.1. Thief, Pirate, Budoo

Change all your party to classes that can steal in battles. I think the game
will check for the dropping ratio for each thief in your party beside the
usual drop-check. It's like you fought four more battles in one.
 For example, when a dropping ratio is 1:500, you get an item from ~500 battles
normally, but with a four-thief party you will make it from only 500/(1+4)=100
battles.


4.7.3.2. ThiefHit

People complain that this method is very poor. I disagree. This is the best
(shortest time) way to get an item. I think the game checks for the dropping
ratio for each hit of the ThiefHit (and I guess ThiefHit steals only when the
target does not die).
 For example, when a dropping ratio is 1:500, you will get an item from ~500
ThiefHits. So if you use ThiefHit ~500 times in one battle, you can get the
desired item in one single battle instead of 500 battles.
 But which monster could stand 500 punches from even the weakest character? The
answer is: the one that has at least 500 HP. If you use the weapon called
Poison/, that will ALWAYS deal 1 damage even when it critically hits. The only
"drawback" is that it allows vital blows, so if your target isn't immune to
"death", he will be defeated in not too many hits. ThiefHit+Poison/ shines very
much when your target is immune to death AND has some healing techniques
(HealMore, HealUs, etc.). My favorite is KingSlime: I could steal a LifeAcorn
from each one that SlimeLv8 created when I was testing.
 But Poison/ isn't in every general store. You get only one as a medal award.
You can replicate it, though! Use ThiefHit+Poison/ on Needlon, they are immune
to death, so you can quickly obtain two more Poison/s. Unfortunately you can
equip Poison/ to Maribel, Gabo, and Melvin only. So only these three characters
need to learn the ThiefHit, the others don't really.
 It seems you can steal only one item per monster, and it seems the monster
whose item you have already stolen do not drop an item if it is defeated last.
So you should watch carefully the noise and text of the theft: "LifeAcorn was
stolen!" because it passes by quickly (I mean there is not the "keypressed"
pause like with a vital blow).
 It seems ThiefHit is ineffective when the drop ratio is 1:1.
 The items stolen by ThiefHit always go in the Bag.


4.8. Monster Taming Methods

There is the Monster Park and your battles with monsters. How do monsters go to
the park? After you get the BeefJerky, you will be able to send monsters to the
park. Don't expect monsters to do anything unusual in battles when you used
the BeefJerky on them (it does NOTHING by the way), or you "tamed" them by the
Tamer skill or Rib; they won't exit battle to make for the park. It's really
"incredible", a monster can go to the park only when he has been killed!
Obtaining the BeefJerky switches on a mechanism that works similarly as the
item-drop check. The monster you killed last, and no matter how many turns were
gone by or how many monsters fled or were banished after that, goes under a
"monster park-check" in the end of the battle. If that kind of monster doesn't
live in the park, yet, or you keep Monster House space for that, he will be
checked for tame ratio, and with good luck you can "obtain" him like an item.
The worst tame ratio is around a medium item drop ratio, 1:200 or 1:300, as
far as I can estimate it. Tame ratios are better than dropping ratios in
general. And you can even better the tame ratio by Tamer skill and one-use
items (Rib, Fillet).
The ways of taming:
-Defeat the monster you want to send to the park last. It is the simplest way,
 though it takes "some" time to complete the park this way.
-Use the Tamer skill on the monster and defeat him last. Use the skill more
 than one time to get better chances for the capture check.
-Use Rib or Fillet on the monster and defeat him last. I could have said "Don't
 use Rib and Fillet" because there is the Tamer skill. Only those characters
 can use these items who have advanced at least level two (Groomer) as Tamer,
 however, they don't have to be Tamers after that. So these items don't replace
 the Tamer class unfortunately.

Some monsters cannot be tamed by Tamer: bosses, Clockmech, trap monsters, but
trap monsters are also checked for tame ratio, so they may go to the park.
SlimeLv8, MetalyS, and cocoon monsters can be tamed, but they never go to the
park, though.
 You should talk to the monster man everytime you sent new monsters and you
want to see them in the park.
 The construction of the Monster Park: bring BluePrints to the man, and if you
want the park to be built, rest at home or stay in an inn. The park will
enlarge by the morning. You can send monsters to the park even if they have no
place yet. Later they will be found as soon as the park gets the new area.


4.9. How to Defeat Metal Slimes?

Metal slimes are good for EXP and level-ups, but they cannot be defeated easily
though. They are immune to almost everything, and have high DEF, higher than
you could deal more than 1 damage usally. And they don't give you too much time
to scratch them to death, they flee often and have high AGL to do it before you
can even raise your sword.
The ways of killing a metal slime:
-Attack normally, because the best they can do about normal attacks is dodge
 sometimes. They have little Max HP, so if they don't flee early, you may hit
 one twenty times with four characters in five turns, and twenty will kill even
 a MetalKing.
-Attack normally, this may result a critical hit that will penetrate the
 target's high DEF and kill it.
-Attack with weapons that hit twice in one turn (Falcon/, Needle/). I recommend
 two variations: you raise your offensive potential with two Needle/s (Aira and
 Maribel): 1x2+1x2+1+1=6 per turn, or you double your chances to lay a critical
 hit with less damage using two Needle/s and two Falcon/s (you and Melvin):
 1x2+1x2+0x2+0x2=4. Note: Falcon/ doesn't take those 1 damage scratches oddly.
 Falcon/ imitates FalconCut, it does normal-25% damage. 1-0.25=0.75 and maybe
 0.75 is rounded to 0, that's why.
-Use Demon\ and Demon). They miss often, but they ALWAYS hit the target
 critically. Unfortunately, you can't equip them to all characters.
-Use EvilSlash. It misses often, but it ALWAYS hits the target critically.
-Use Massacre. It ALWAYS hits the target critically, though it may hit any of
 you as well. Massacre works best when your adversary is only one or two
 MetalKings or PlatKings and no other monsters. One character should use the
 Massacre skill, the rest should use ParryPass. It's still risky, but the
 chances are on your side.
-If you have really strong characters in your party already, they can deal some
 damage to high DEF targets. Metaly appears in bands of eight in the Krage
 area. You may score them all using the Ultimate~ (a strong multi-target weapon
 that seems to miss not as often as a boomerang) and earn 8000 points of EXP.
 PlatKing has not just high DEF (800) but also high Max HP (~200) for a metal
 slime. So you should do bonus damage, too, to defeat a PlatKing in one or two
 turns. Have an agile support (Maribel, Gabo) cast TwinHits on your strong
 warrior, and he should use 2EdgeHit (+50%) or Bite (max +50%). You can use the
 Berserker (+100%) or MetalCut (+50%) while also the supports attack trying to
 lay critical hits instead of casting TwinHits.
-Change everybody to classes that may lay a critical hit more often and attack
 normally (Fighter, Dragoon, SkyDevil, Golem from D. Short's guide).
-Equip Aira with Blade# (may return 1/4 damage to attacker) and Massacre/ (sets
 DEF to 0), and order her to do the Guardian (of course put a Bounce on her).
 When a MetalKing attacks her, the monster may get 1/4 damage (169/2/4=21) that
 will be enough to kill himself.
-Don't expect EerieLite to lift immunities for spells or skills. They are
 immune to EerieLite also.
-They are immune to PoisonFog.
-They are immune to instant death, so vital blows or death spells don't work.
-They are immune to KnockDown, so the skills like Tackle, Ramming don't work.

The ways to prevent metal slimes of fleeing:
-You may be successful with some lose-turn techniques (BoxerDanc, LureDance,
 Bark vs. MetalKing, PlatKing) or putting them to sleep (Metaly, PlatKing),
 but your characters will also lose (waste) turns trying to tie the monsters
 down. Using Sleep/ on PlatKing works the best due to his BounceOn and high
 evasion.
-It's better to change all your party to TeenIdol, JewelBag, Bombcrag classes,
 they may stun the monsters every now and then.
-It's a good idea to equip DreamH to Maribel, her sexy wear may stun the
 monsters every now and then.
-There are random battles that begin "But monsters looked stunned!" or "But
 monsters haven't noticed yet!", so your party get a bonus turn. This is a good
 opportunity to finish metal slimes.
-Change all your party to EvilWell class. This is a way to get a bonus "first
 strike turn" similarly as above more frequently.
-Use Time Sand when the big fish has fled. Metabble appears generally with
 other slimes (Slime, CureSlime, Healer, etc.) in Krage area, so you are able
 to restart battle when the Metabble escaped but at least one monster is left.
 I was able to defeat many a Metabble this way.


4.10. A Special Quick Level-up Tip for Classless ("Whistless") Games

If you play DW7 Classless, you will miss Whistle badly, because you have to
walk around miles to get a random battle. If you want to level-up quickly
somewhere in the middle of disc one, you should fight battles of the most EXP
earned. Metaly would come to your mind (1000 EXP), but they appear not very
often and they tend to flee often once you encountered some at last.
 There is a more effective way to earn huge EXP (100,000-1,000,000). You
encounter SlimeLv8 in Mountain Tower. You should let one call for help, but do
not let them merge into KingSlime. How? If a single one appears, it is simple.
If three of them appear, and it is more usual, your party must defeat two, and
let the one call for help. Then using Sleep/s, two of your party should put
the eight Slimes to sleep, the others use Wind/ or IceW or Destruct/ or the
like on the group. Brandished items will not wake up sleeping monsters as
standard attacks often do. If you have brandished the right items the right
times, there will be only one or two or three Slimes, whom you should finish,
leaving only a single one alone. When he wakes up, just let him call for help
to circulate the slaughter. SlimeLv8 gives you "only" 150 EXP, but you kill
them in large bunches, so it is far better than Metaly. You can even accomplish
a Guinness record of hard-coreness, you reach Lv 99 in one single battle!
 Later in the game the other metal slimes give you quicker EXP. Play Lucky
Panel for a Demon\ and go to Krage, you will find yourselves at Lv99 quickly.


5. Lists


5.1. Monster Abilities

Here are the nasty tricks of monsters. First I tried to list them systematized
(spells, breath attacks, status tricks, attack skills, etc.) but I failed
(Is SleepHit, for one, an attack skill or a status trick?), so I found it best
to list them by order of appearence (I hate alphabetical lists). I hope this
list will help you to estimate the threats of your enemies.

Ability name: Where I don't know its "official" name, I use a name by my own
 following the nine character limit.
Coming: This text appears when the ability is about to be used. Just for you to
 recognize the ability.
Effect: This text appears when the ability takes effect.
Fade: This text appears when the effect caused by the ability fades.
Avoided: This text appears when the ability fails due to defense, evasion or
 immunity.
Force: Initial damage or value from the ability.
Target: The targeting and the hits of the ability. Some abilities are absolute
 targeting (they ignore party formation as Guardian, Scapegoat).
Retaliate: How the ability is copied.
MP Cost: The ability uses MP.
Explanation: I explain what is going on and I give you some hints what to do.

mr = monster;
sy = somebody of your party.


Attack

Coming: [mr] attacked!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normal
Target: one
Retaliate: attack
It seems to be a normal attack in a different movement.


Flee

Coming: [mr] fled!
Target: self
There are monsters that sometimes escape from battle. It can be an annoying
ability. Not just your party is stripped of EXP, but if you wanted to tame that
one or needed the item he might drop, then it's gone. They flee more often when
your party is too strong for them, or they are wounded.


LureDance

Coming: [mr] danced LureDance!
Effect: [sy] was absorbed in dancing!..[sy] was absorbed in dancing!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: N/A
Target: one
Retaliate: same
Target loses a turn. It can be prevented by DanceShut.


LushLicks

Coming: [mr] licked [sy]'s face!
Effect: [sy] got goose bumps!..[sy] is shuddering.
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: N/A
Target: one
Retaliate: same
Target loses a turn.


Watch

Coming: [mr] is watching.
Target: self
The enemy is doing nothing, you got a free turn!


Blaze

Coming: [mr] cast Blaze!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: 12-15
Target: one
Retaliate: same
MP cost: 2
A weak offensive spell. Early on it can be painful because there is no
protective equipment against it yet.


Heal

Coming: [mr] cast Heal!
Effect: [mr]'s wounds were healed!
Force: 30-40
Target: one
MP cost: 2
The monsters can stand your offense a little longer by this spell. Try to kill
them by concentrated offense instead of scattering your attacks on numerous
targets.


StrongD

Coming: [mr] gets ready to take any attack!
Target: self
The monster is defending himself reducing the damage you do to him to 1/10.
This way he can absorb even the strongests of your arsenal, you will just waste
a turn and MP. However, he can be rooted out by some bad-status trick or breath
attacks. And if it is your healing turn, then you are lucky.


Parry

Coming: [mr] is parrying!
Target: self
The monster is defending himself halving the damage you do to him. It can be a
problem if you aimed a parrying one, for he absorbs your force while the others
take the chance to attack you. And it can be annoying when you wanted to kill
last some other monster for a possible item or taming, and this one survives
the turn and the others die.


Sap

Coming: [mr] cast Sap!
Effect: [sy]'s DEF was reduced by X!
Fade: [sy]'s defense has returned to normal!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: N/A
Target: one
Retaliate: same
MP cost: 3
This spell halves a character's defense. It can be a problem because even if
you have the thickest armor and the highest GRD, this spell just can eliminate
them leaving you more vulnerable to attacks. You can do two things about it:
you wait parrying until the effect has gone (5-6 turns) or raise the Sapped
character's DEF back to normal by Upper. It might worth the effort to prevent
it by some way (StopSpell, Bounce, MagicWall) because there is no equipment
that could parry this kind of spell.


Charge

Coming: [mr] charged [sy]!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: But [sy] was unaffected!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normal+30%
Target: one
Retaliate: attack
Generally monsters have a stronger attack, namely a skilled strike beside the
normal attack. This is one.


OddDance

Coming: [mr] danced OddDance!
Effect: [sy]'s MP was reduced by X!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: N/A
Target: one
Retaliate: same
It reduces only a small amount of MP, however, in the beginning your characters
have very modest Max MP, so mana is blood. Later you will be able to prevent it
by DanceShut, but then MP will not matter so much.


FrigidAir

Coming: [mr] spewed frigid breath!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: 13-16
Target: all
Retaliate: same
An ice based skill, a breath attack. Early on it is the most dangerous monster
ability because there is no protective equipment against it yet.


IceBolt

Coming: [mr] cast IceBolt!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: 25-35
Target: one
Retaliate: same
MP cost: 3
A weak offensive spell. Early on it can be painful because there is no
protective equipment against it yet.


BackFlip

Coming: [mr] jumped sky high! [mr] made a sommersault and slashed!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: (ATK/2-DEF/4)-D
Target: all
Retaliate: same
If you haven't good armor, the enemy can bring you in a nasty situation by this
skill. Every DefenseUp method helps (Upper, Increase).


JumpAttak

Coming: [mr] jump attacked!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normal+30%
Target: one
Retaliate: same
Generally monsters have a stronger attack, namely a skilled strike beside the
normal attack. This is one.


SandStorm

Coming: [mr] breathed SandStorm!
Effect: Sand got into [sy]'s eyes!
Fade: [sy]'s SandStorm effect has faded!
Avoided: [sy] nimbly shook off the sand!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: N/A
Target: all
Retaliate: same
It makes your characters miss the target often for a couple of turns. It is
time to unleash your offensive spells or skills that never miss.


PoisonHit

Coming: [mr] attacked!
Effect: [sy] took X damage! [sy] is poisoned!
        [sy] took X damage!
Fade: [sy] was cured of poison!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normal
Target: one
Retaliate: attack
An attack that both causes damage and may poison the target. Poison lasts for
about 15 turns, if you finish the battle sooner, then your character will
remain poisoned. The poison hasn't any influence on the battle, but afterwards
the exploration of the dungeon will be more difficult losing HP by the step.
Do not waste a turn to use Antidotes in the battle, you should do it after you
defeated the enemy.


FireAir

Coming: [mr] breathed flames!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: 5-10
Target: all
Retaliate: same
A fire based skill, a breath attack. It is not so dangerous (at 1-2 HP it is a
kill of course), however, numerously taken it can slowly run your party's HP
down.


ChargeAll

Coming: [mr] charged your party!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normal-50%
Target: all
Retaliate: same
An attack that hits all of you scoring more damage against your party.


ChargeUp

Coming: [mr] is gathering power!
Target: self
The enemy is pausing for power. You got a safe turn, but in the next one you
should care for defense, because your opponent will attack with double force
(force: normalx2). You can defend yourselves (parry, StrongD, etc.) or
return the powered-up strike to him by ParryPass, however, it's risky.


Help

Coming: [mr] called for help!
Effect: Incredibly, [mrX] appears!
Target: new
The enemy tries to outnumber Your party by gathering further monsters into the
battle. If your offensive potential isn't enough to handle the replication,
then you should try to put some bad status (sleep, shock, confuse, etc.) on
them or flee. Also a good plan to wait and only cause wounds to them until the
screen is full (then no more can come), and kill them all at the same time.


Coil

Coming: [mr] coiled around [sy]!
Effect: [sy]'s body is constricted tightly! [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normal+30%
Target: one
Retaliate: same
Generally monsters have a stronger attack, namely a skilled strike beside the
normal attack. This is one.


PoisonGas

Coming: [mr] breathed PoisonGas!
Effect: [sy] is poisoned!
Fade: [sy] was cured of poison!
Avoided: [sy] dodged the breath!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: N/A
Target: group
Retaliate: same
It can poison everyone in your group. Poison lasts for about 15 turns, if you
finish the battle sooner, then your characters will remain poisoned. The poison
hasn't any influence on the battle, but afterwards the exploration of the area
will be more difficult losing HP by the step. Do not waste a turn to use
Antidotes in the battle, you should do it after you defeated the enemy.


Miss

Coming: [mr] attacked!
Effect: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
Avoided: N/A
Force: N/A
Target: one, absolute
Retaliate: N/A
The enemy cannot fight well, you got a safe turn.


SleepHit

Coming: [mr] attacked!
Effect: [sy] took X damage! [sy] fell asleep!..[sy] is asleep!
        [sy] took X damage!
Fade: [sy] woke up!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normal
Target: one
Retaliate: attack
An attack that both causes damage and may put the target to sleep.


WindBeast

Coming: [mr] released WindBeast!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: But [sy] was unaffected!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: level dependent
Target: one
Retaliate: same
A wind based attack that ignores DEF, so try to keep HP on top or parry when
the situation is not safe. This skill is very popular among the bosses.


Flash

Coming: [mr] radiated blinding light from the entire body!
Effect: [sy]'s eyes were dazzled!
Fade: no text
Avoided: [sy] kept eyes closed and dodged!
Force: N/A
Target: all
Retaliate: same
It makes your characters miss the target often for a turn or two. It is time to
unleash your offensive spells or skills that never miss.


RainSlash

Coming: [mr] released RainSlash!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normal, decreasing
Target: all
Retaliate: same
An attack that hits all of you scoring more damage against your party.


Slash

Coming: [mr] slashed violently!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normal+30%
Target: one

normal attack. This is one.


Firebal

Coming: [mr] cast Firebal!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: 16-24
Target: group
Retaliate: same
MP cost: 4
A weak offensive spell. Early on it can be painful because there is no
protective equipment against it yet.


BrutalHit(c)

Coming: [mr] attacked!
Effect: A brutal hit! [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: critical
Target: one
Retaliate: attack
It is a very dangerous skill, because it ignores DEF and hits hard. You cannot
ParryPass it because it is a brutal HIT, once it has hit then there is nothing
else to parry (at least this is the only logic I see why you can't). However,
you can dodge it by increasing your evasion. Also a good plan to order some of
you to defend (parry, StrongD) increasing the chance to block instead of taking
in a grave damage to one of you anyway.


SleepAir

Coming: [mr] breathed SleepAir!
Effect: [sy] fell asleep!..[sy] is asleep!
Fade: [sy] woke up!
Avoided: [sy] didn't fall asleep!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!

anything secure about it.

Effect: [sy] took X damage!
        Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
Avoided: [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: critical
Target: one
Retaliate: same
It misses often, but once you are hit, it ignores your DEF and hits hard. So
try to finish foe in less turns and the chance of obtaining a big nasty "item"
will be lower. You can also try ParryPass though it is risky.


Massacre

Coming: [mr] flew into a rage and attacked [sy/mr]!
Effect: [sy/mr] took X damage!
Avoided: [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: critical
Target: one
Retaliate: N/A
A powerful attack that ignores DEF. However, this skill is a lottery in battle.
If you are lucky, the enemy will work for you, if you aren't, then you will not
be lucky, for sure. If you ParryPass all along the battle, the chances will be
on your side, but that's not secure either.


2EdgeHit

Coming: [mr] took a risk and ran at [sy]!
Effect: [sy] took X damage! [mr] took X/4 damage!

takes less damage, but slowly he will die frequently using this technique even
if you cannot do a scratch to him.

MagicWall

Coming: [mr] cast MagicWall!
Effect: no text
Fade: [mr]'s spell resistance has returned to normal!
Target: all
MP cost: 2
The enemy can raise its spell resistance by this spell. It reduces the chances
of success of Sleep, Sap, etc. and the damage of offensive spells (and even
some skills) by 25%, so what worked on it before the MagicWall, that may easily
fail. You should wait with the spells until it has faded.


Sleep

Coming: [mr] cast Sleep!
Effect: [sy] fell asleep!..[sy] is asleep!
Fade: [sy] woke up!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: N/A
Target: group
Retaliate: same
MP cost: 3

them quickly providing them less oppurtinity to heal.


Firebane

Coming: [mr] cast Firebane!
Effect: [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: 30-42
Target: group
Retaliate: same
MP cost: 6
A medium offensive spell. Early on when your characters have low Max HP, you
should be careful until the enemy has used up his MP and is unable to cast it
any more. Later it will not be so dangerous because there are lots of equipment
that reduce it.


Defense

Coming: [mr] cast Defense!
Effect: [sy]'s DEF was reduced by X!
Fade: [sy]'s defense has returned to normal!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: N/A
Target: group
Retaliate: same
MP cost: 4
This spell reduces your group's defense by DEF/4. It can be a problem because
even if you have the thickest armor and the highest GRD, this spell just can
eliminate them leaving you more vulnerable to attacks. You can do two things
about it: you wait parrying until the effect has gone (5-6 turns) or raise your
characters' DEF back to normal by Upper. It might worth the effort to prevent
it by some way (StopSpell, Bounce, MagicWall) because there is no equipment
that could parry this kind of spell. Also a good plan to order some of you to
Retaliate. This way you can make the enemy's spell dual-edged without MP use.


StopSpell

Coming: [mr] cast StopSpell!
Effect: [sy]'s spells were sealed!
Fade: [sy]'s StopSpell has faded!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: N/A
Target: group
Retaliate: same
MP cost: 3
This spell seals target's spells for around ten turns. It can be a serious
problem if you want to cast Heal or HealMore to heal. Be sure to give your
party some healing items before the battle.

Coming: [mr] cast Beat!
Effect: [sy] died!
Avoided: [sy] was unaffected!
Force: death
Target: one
Retaliate: same
MP cost: 4
This spell is a very dangerous monster ability because it can kill a character
fast as pie. You can avoid it by items (LifeRock, AngelT), however, the
cheapest way is Bounce though you will need high AGL or good luck.


RobMagic

Force: N/A

PsycheUp

Coming: [mr] took a deep breath!

The enemy is pausing for power. You got a safe turn, but in the next one you
should care for defense, because your opponent will attack with double force
(force: normalx2). You can defend yourselves (parry, StrongD, etc.) or
return the powered-up strike to him by ParryPass, however, it's risky.


Herb

Coming: [mr] used Herb!
Effect: [mr]'s wounds were healed!
Force: 30-40
Target: one
The monsters can stand your offense a little longer by this skill (or item?).

numerous targets.

Effect: A brutal hit! [sy] took X damage!
Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: normalx2
Target: one
Retaliate: attack
This skill can score great damage without a warning if you haven't thick armor.
You cannot ParryPass it, however, boosting up your DEF by Upper will solve the
problem. Also you can try to dodge it by increasing your evasion though it is
not secure.


HPRegain

Effect: no text
Force: 1:~20, 2:~50, 3:~100
Target: self

Force: (ATK/2-DEF/4)/2+67
Target: 2xhit any, absolute
Retaliate: N/A
This is an odd ability. Partly normal damage, but there is a fix part that not

Effect: [mr]'s ATK was doubled!
Target: one
MP cost: 6
This spell doubles a monster's attack power (force: normalx2), so you should
care for defense until your opponent's effect has faded (5-6 turns). Upper or
thick armor helps a lot. Also you can return the powered-up strikes to him by
ParryPass though it's risky.

Avoided: Miss! [sy] was unharmed!
         [sy] easily dodges out of the way!
Force: ATK-DEF/2
Target: one
Retaliate: same
It can be a powerful attack if you haven't thick armor, but this ability is a
great weakness of the user in the other hand because the attacker will get
double damage in that turn: if you did 1-2 damage to this monster, he will take
2-4 damage, that's not too much, but if you did ~50, he will take ~100 and
maybe die!


Time Sand

Coming: [mr] sprinkled Time Sand!

This skill (or item?) sets the battle to the very start making everything

can save your party from defeat either if you are on the lose.

Parry(s)

Coming: [mr] is parrying!

The representation of annoyance. You try to build up the power of your party,
and this skill ruins all. Bounce, MagicWall, Barrier, WoolGuard, FairWind,

characters. You can risk somebody to do the Guardian to collect the "blessings"
and the others will be fine. (I always get a naked feel after DeMagic.)

Guardian

having Bounce or Bounce/ always at hand.

5.3. Monster Locations

Where can you find a certain monster to tame for the park or merely encounter
him to complete the Monster Book? Also there are some really patient players
who wish to have the dropped item entry for every monster in the Book, so they
want to choose locations where there are the right monster combinations of no
item dropped.
 There was an attempt to list all locations by Kesac, unfortunately unfinished.
So I took on the task and here they are. However, I miss the temporary dungeon
Halflings' Cave where I could not go back yet, but maybe someday I will reveal
it too.


5.3.1. Monster Name Index

You have not found a monster in this FAQ? Some monsters' names are shortened to
nine characters, maybe that's why. I listed some names that may be problematic:

Name        Name in DW7  Name in this FAQ
EvilMantis  EvlMantis    EvlMantis
LizardBird  LizrdBird    LizrdBird
RedSting    Red Sting    Red Sting
MetalRider  MetlRider    MetlRider
EvilStatue  EvlStatue    EvlStatue
SkullBlade  SkulBlade    SkulBlade
ShieldOgre  ShieldOgr    ShieldOgr
EvilVulgar  EvlVulgar    EvlVulgar
SteelDemon  StelDemon    StelDemon
PodFighter  PodFightr    PodFightr
FooFighter  FoFighter    FoFighter
HellKaiser  HelKaiser    HelKaiser
PutreBeast  Putrbeast    Putrbeast
EvilAnchor  EvlAnchor    EvlAnchor
EvilTurtle  EvlTurtle    EvlTurtle
Falrodier   Falroider    Falrodier
FlameSpirit FlameV       FlameV

Monster heart names are shortened to eight characters for the item symbol:

Berserker = Berserkr
EvlTurtle = EvlTurtl
LizardMan = LizrdMan
DrakSlime = DrakSlim
ProtoMech = ProtMech
CurseLamp = CursLamp
HellGiant = HelGiant
DeadNoble = DeadNobl
WoePriest = WoPriest
GigaMute  = Mutant


5.3.2. Further Possible Monsters in Locations

one. This way you can find such monsters in a place that are not originally
available there. They are:
