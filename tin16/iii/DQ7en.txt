Review							[FREVIEW]
-----==

 NOTE: This review is written with the Render/Knights RPG Rating Scales.
The purpose of this system is to provide a review that has as little
personal bias as possible.  For more information on this scale, see:
http://sky_render.tripod.com/review_scale.txt

Dragon Warrior VII

Gameplay:

Repitition      [---------*]

 The battles are generally variations on the exact same strategies.  The
various events in the game tend to also show a lot of repitition.

Depth           [---*------]

 There's very little depth to the gameplay system.  It's mostly just the
normal deal of leveling up, with a bit of class-changing thrown in.

Learning Curve  [-*--------]

 Being from the series that started the whole console RPG genre, this
game's learning curve is appropriately short.

Difficulty      [-------*--]

 At it's hardest, the game can be annoying, though it's usually only
average in difficulty.

Continuity      [--*-------]

 Some bosses are incredibly hard, while others are easy as pie.  Random
encounter enemies are almost always easy, with a few exceptions.

Interface       [-------*--]

 The interface is very fluid and easy to manage.  It can be a bit annoying
at times, though.


Graphics:

Suitability     [------*---]

 Not much appears to be out of place for the environment that they're in.

Quality         [--*-------]

 There are first-generation PlayStation games with better quality of
graphics than this game has.

Fluidity        [------*---]

 The occasional graphical glitch can be spotted, as well as the normal
texture warping caused by the PSX, but for the most part, the graphics all
flow smoothly.


Sound and Music:

Instrumentation [-----*----]

 The instrumentation is nothing special.  There are better, and there are
much worse.

Tonal Quality   [---*------]

 Sound effects tend to be very low quality, almost as bad as what an 8-bit
sound system produces.

Balance         [------*---]

 The music manages to avoid being overly repetitive, for the most part.
Some of the songs, however, sound completely different near the end than
they do near the beginning or middle.

Suitability     [---*------]

 Unfortunately, most of the songs are either used far too much, or not
nearly enough, and some are used in situations that they make no sense in.


Story:

Continuity      [--*-------]

 There are a few poltholes, but the big problem is that the main story is
more or less ignored for 3/4ths of the game.  The side-stories are all very
disconnected from each other, with only a few exceptions.

Depth of Focus  [--*-------]

 What little focus is put on the main story isn't very deep.  Likewise, the
side-stories are usually simple, with only one or two twists each, at best.

Clarity         [--------*-]

 Though confusing at times, there aren't any scenes that downright make you
say "huh?".  Most of the confusing stuff is due to translation errors.

Translation     [------*---]

 Lots of small errors are spread throughout the game, but most won't be
spotted by the average gamer.

The Class System					[GMCLASSES]
---------------==

===============--
How Classes Work

 Class-changing isn't available from the start.  You first have to reach
the legendary Dharma Temple (found in many Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest
games since the third game), and then you can change your class by talking
to the high priest.

 Each class has eight levels of competence, ranging from no experience to
mastering a job.  The levels for classes are not gained from regular battle
experience, however.  Rather, classes gain levels depending on how many
battles you fight in that guise.  As such, you can actually master powerful
classes long before your level reflects the skills that they impart to you.

 There is a catch, however.  You can only gain experience for your classes
against monsters that are considered worthy opponents.  There is no sure-
fire way to find out what this level is, save for talking to an old woman
at Dharma to find out how many battles you need to gain a class level,
fighting a few battles, and asking her again to see if the value has
changed.  An interesting thing to note, though, is that it's the area that
holds the level limit for class level gaining, and not the monsters
themselves.  One area in the game has no level limit at all, and that area
is mostly filled with Slime monsters of various breeds.

 The key to successful class leveling is minimizing experience earned.
You can't do this very effectively in later areas, but it's quite easy
early on.  Simply gain the Thief skill KnockDown, and use that against all
but one enemy per battle.  This will lower your experience gain by as much
as three fourths, giving you far more time to level up classes.

 Once a class is mastered, the path to higher level classes is opened.  By
mastering, for example, the Cleric and Mage classes, you will be able to
access the intermediate class Sage.  As you gain levels for each class, you
also gain new spells and skills for your job.  These skills range from
utterly useless to life-saving and eternally valuable.  Some classes are
essentially dead ends, but most gain you abilities and skills that you will
reap the benefits of long after you have mastered the class.

 Another interesting ability is the ability to learn dual-class skills.
These abilities stem from maturing a class (five or more stars), and then
maturing another class.  Unfortunately, you don't automatically learn these
special skills when switching between multiple classes.  Say you wanted
ThiefHit, but you matured Thief, Fighter, and then Warrior.  You wouldn't
learn ThiefHit this way. You would have to start with either Thief or
Warrior classes, and switch to the other one once the class has matured
(holding off until it's mastered is fine, too).  See Class Misconceptions
for more information on how to get a character to learn special skills even
when they've mastered one or both of the classes required without gaining
the abilities.

 Higher level classes give added incentive to mastering them in the form of
stat bonuses.  However, these bonuses only remain as long as you stay in
that class.  They can be useful for winning the various contests at the
WRF, though.


===================--
Class Misconceptions

 There are a few erroneous views of the class system out there, and that's
what this section is about.

MISCONCEPTION #1: You need a Hero Heart to change an ally into the Hero
class.
TRUTH: The Hero Heart is not required, it simply allows anybody to take up
the Hero class without mastering three intermediate or advanced jobs first.
I should know, I've mastered every one of my characters in the Hero class,
and moved on to other classes.

MISCONCEPTION #2: Once a class is mastered, you can't learn any dual-class
abilities that it would have granted.
TRUTH: You just have to switch back to the mastered class, and fight enough
battles so that your allies get back into the spirit of their previously
mastered class (the game refers to it as "making up").  After that, it's
just like normal, and you merely have to either have matured the class you
want to get a dual-class skill from already, or mature it immediately
afterwards.


==============--
Regular Classes						[GMRCLASS]

 These classes are the ones that you can access without monster hearts by
asking the high priest at the Dharma Temple to change your class.


Basic Classes

no mastery bonuses, and have larger drawbacks (and smaller bonuses) than
higher classes.  Despite this, they are the key to reaching the higher
level classes.

example of a heavy hitter class.

NOTE ON TAMERS: Using the Tamer skill increases the likelihood of a monster
turning tame after the end of the battle.  The effect is also cumulative,
meaining that if you use it about four or five times on a particularly
stubborn monster, you'll almost definitely recruit them for the park.  Be
aware, though, that you can't use multiple people casting Tamer on the same
monster, as the cumulative effect of Tamer is specific to each individual

Regular Classes: Quick Overview

 Below is a chart of every class, and what classes lead to what, and which
classes are dead ends.

Ranger <--   Mage   -->  Sage  --> Summoner <-- TeenIdol
  ^                        ^                   ^   ^   ^
  |                        |                  /    |    \
Warrior                 Cleric             Dancer Bard Jester
  |                        |
  V                        V         Tamer <-- Thief --> Pirate
Dragoon <-- Fighter --> Paladin        ^                    ^
  \                        /           |                    |
   `-----> Godhand <------'         Shepherd             Mariner

            Any 3 Intermediate/Master Jobs --> Hero

And in textual form:

Basic-to-Intermediate:
Warrior & Fighter = Dragoon
Warrior & Mage = Ranger
Fighter & Cleric = Paladin
Mage & Cleric = Sage
Thief & Mariner = Pirate
Thief & Shepherd = Trainer
Dancer, Bard, & Jester = TeenIdol

Intermediate-to-Master:
Dragoon & Paladin = Godhand
Sage & TeenIdol = Summoner
Any 3 Intermediate/Master Jobs = Hero


The ideal path of class changing for hybrid skills is as follows.  Note
that the ability gained for Sage/TeenIdol is not included, as that ability
is so far removed in learning from the others.  This plan will also get you
mastered in all base classes.

==============--
Monster Classes						[GMMCLASS]

 You can take on the classes of monsters, too.  This requires monster
hearts (rare items that monsters most likely won't drop), and each heart is
good for only one class change.  The monster job heirarchy is much more
complicated than the regular job heirarchy, and requires a steadfast
devotion to master them.

 An important thing to remember is that, once you gain one star level in a
monster job, you can access it at all times without using a monster heart.
This being so, be SURE that you gain at least one class level in any
monster jobs that you gain from monster hearts before changing your class
again!

 Personally, I see monster classes as way too time-consuming to be of
practical use.  The amount of effort required to master all of them is even
more astounding than how long it would take you to master all of the non-
monster classes.  Only those utterly obsessed or utterly insane should try.
The time it takes to gain useful abilities from monsters is obscenely long,
and far from worth the effort.

The Classes

 This section is not complete.  A few of the monster jobs' specific class
level names are not listed.

Basic Monster Classes

 These are the classes for which you must have a monster heart to access
them.  Most are easy to master, and all of them lead you towards higher
monster classes.

Slime - Slime is sort of a stepping-stone class.  Nobody in their right
mind would want to stay in this class for a moment longer than necessary,
since (much like the enemy) the Slime class is obscenely weak.

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Str -20%, Agl +5%, Grd -20%, Int -30%, Apr -20%, HP -20%,
MP -20%
Battles Required to Master Class: 120

Moist		7/8		None
Wiggly		15/18		SideStep
Jiggly		33/17		None
Slurry		50/22		ConfuHit
SlimeNite	72/18		None
SlimeHero	90/30		None
KingSlime	120/0		Retaliate

Wyvern - Another basic monster class, Wyvern is only slightly better than
Slime.  Once again, you'll want to master this as quickly as possible, so
you can move onto more important classes.

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Str -5%, Agl +5%, Grd -15%, Int +5%, Apr -5%, HP -10%
Battles Required to Master Class: 150

DiveBomb	62/28		None
BeakDuel	90/35		BlazeMore
HiWyvern	125/25		None
WyverNite	150/0		BlazeAir

Healer - Like the enemy of the same name, the Healer class is pretty much
only helpful when you need to restore your HP.  Another stepping-stone
class, though it can provide very early access to the HealUs spell.

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Str -30%, Agl -20%, Grd -10%, Int +20%, Apr -20%,
HP -20%, MP +20%
Battles Required to Master Class: 160

Class Rank	Total/For Next	New Abilities Learned
KindHeart	0/8		None

HealAll		70/22		None
GoldenOne	92/41		HealAll
Truehart	133/27		None
Phoenix		160/0		HealUs

Hork - This class screams "useless".  Worthless skills and heavy stat
penalties make this perhaps the most painful stepping-stone class to
complete.

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Agl -30%, Grd -10%, Int -50%, Apr -60%, HP +10%, MP -10%
Battles Required to Master Class: 130

Class Rank	Total/For Next	New Abilities Learned

WormFood	52/23		None
Maggoty		75/24		CurseSong
Undead		99/31		None
EvilDead	130/0		K.O.Dance

JewelBag - For a low-level class, the JewelBag has some good bonuses.  The
abilities learned are generally not too helpful (since a lot of enemies are
immune to status effects), but at least the leveling up is tolerable.

Class Effects: Can stun enemies randomly in battle
Stat Adjustments: Str -20%, Agl +20%, Grd +10%, Int +10%, Apr +5%, HP -10%

Emerald		72/28		None
Sapphire	100/30		PanicAll
Ruby		130/30		None
Diamond		160/0		Beat

Mimic - Though I wouldn't recommend staying in it, the Mimic class has a
very useful class ability.  Regardless, it's required for reaching the best
class in the game, so you really don't have much of a choice.

Class Effects: Can stun enemies at the start of battle
Stat Adjustments: Str +10%, Grd +20%, Int -20%, Apr -30%, HP -20%, MP -10%

Coffer		80/25		None
MagicBox	105/32		Beat
Dopplgang	137/42		None
Pandora		179/0		Defeat

Lizardman - Not a very good class those Lizardmen have.  RainSlash is only
useful if you get this class early on, which is pretty much right out.  It
is an important class for getting access to PlatKing, though.

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Str -10%, Agl +5%, Int -10%, Apr -10%, HP -10%, MP -10%

Draconian	68/25		None
ScalyLord	93/34		None
ScalyKing	127/18		None
ColdBlood	145/0		RainSlash

EvilTurtl - Sort of an "eh" class, EvilTurtl is mostly a sub-par stepping
stone towards better monster classes.  There's really not much else to say
about it.

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Str +10%, Grd +10%, Int -30%, Apr -30%, HP -20%, MP -10%

ShellHead	60/25		None
DarkTurtl	85/15		None
ShellShoc	100/25		None
HellShell	125/0		BackFlip

Florajay - Definitely a stepping-stone class.  HealSong is only useful very
early on, and good luck getting a Florajay heart then.

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Str -10%, Agl +10%, Grd -20%, Int -5%, HP -10%, MP +10%

FlyTrap		80/40		None

Dumbira - A very sucky class.  'Nuff said.

Class Effects: None

HP -10%, MP -10%

Lipsy - Another sucky monster class?  What are the odds?  Nothing else to
say about it...

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Str -20%, Agl +5%, Grd -10%, Int -20%, Apr -30%, HP -20%

BoltRat - Sucky class, stepping stone, yadda yadda yadda...  Starting to
notice a trend here?

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Str -10%, Agl +10%, Grd +10%, Int -30%, Apr -10%,

ThundeRat	92/36		None
StormRat	128/28		None
ThorRat		156/0		Zap

BombCrag - Big, dumb, and slow describes BombCrags well.  Not a very good
class, though you do get the powerful Meditate skill when you complete it.
Too bad Meditate is outclassed by HealAll.

Class Effects: Can randomly scare enemies during battle
Stat Adjustments: Str +5%, Agl -50%, Grd +20%, Int -30%, Apr -40%, HP +10%,

Berserker - Nothing special.  Yep, that about describes it.  Very important
class for getting PlatKing, but not much else.

Second-Level Monster Classes

 These classes are built off of various basic monster classes, and as such,
you don't necessarily need a monster heart to get to them.

DrakSlime - For a second-level class, DrakSlime is a bit disappointing.
You do learn Ironize from it, as well as BeDragon, so it's not a total
waste of time (especially not if you're aiming for PlatKing).

HornSlime	70/30		None
SoarSlime	100/30		BlazeAir
Slagoner	130/20		IceAir
Drakon		150/0		BeDragon

SkyDevil - Now this is more like it.  If you can get SkyDevil early enough,
you can get some really good skills from it (including Vacuum, one of the
best non-MP-using hits-all-enemies moves you can learn).

Class Effects: Critical hit rate up

Hellborn	150/30		Vacuum
Inferno		180/0		FalconCut

EvilWell - Well-laden with skills, the EvilWell class is nonetheless not as
useful as it could be.  Most of what it can do is status effect-based
(which is notoriously ineffective).

Class Effects: Can stun enemies at the start of battle
Stat Adjustments: Str +10%, Agl +10%, Grd +10%, Int -30%, Apr -30%,

Varanus - Not a very impressive class, is it?  Varanus is more or less
useless, unless you're after the <font color=blue>GigaMute</font> class.

Golem - An unimpressive class, the Golem is critical for getting the
legendary PlatKing class, and as such, you're more or less stuck mastering
it.

Class Effects: Critical hit rate up

Gerion - Since you have no choice in the matter if you want to get the best
monster class, you'll have to go through the Gerion class.  Yes, it does
give sucky abilities.  Live with it.

CurseLamp - This class is nothing special, and probably not worth going
through, unless you want to learn Summon without having to go through the
Sage class.  Yeah, I'm running out of things to say about all of these
mediocre monster classes.

Third-Level Monster Classes

 These monster classes combine first and second level monster classes to
form more powerful monster classes.  They require a lot of battles to
master, and even more just to reach them.

HellGiant - Eh.  There's nothing this class learns that can't be learned
elsewhere for far less time investment.  I'd skip over it if I were you.

Rosevine - Now here's a monster class with an actually useful ability.  How
rare, huh?  It's well worth it to learn said ability, since it does massive
damage, more than enough to make a dent on most every boss.

Fourth-Level Monster Classes

 These are classes that are just short of the two ultimate monster classes.
They combine various classes from other monster class levels to make for
very powerful monster classes.  But their mastery cost is utterly obscene.

WoePriest - For all the work it takes to get to this class, it's just plain
not worth it.  None of the skills it teaches are unique, and all of them
can be learned via other classes far faster.

Budoo - Okay, so CallArmy and WhiteFire are pretty good, but for all the
work it takes to get them, Budoo is just not worth the effort.

EvilMech - Though it lacks a wide array of useful abilities, the EvilMech
is the next-to-last step in gaining the Esterk class, which is required for
PlatKing.  That being so, it's worth it to bear with the class until you
have mastered it.

RainHawk - If you're trying to win the appearance contest in Litorud, this
is the class to do it with.  Not much to say about it other than that.
Yeah, it has WhiteFire.  Big whoop, it takes an eternity to get to the
class as it is.

Master Monster Classes

 These are the two top monster classes, and the most time-expensive ones to
access.  Good luck reaching them!

Esterk - One big mech, the Esterk is capable of decimating just about
anything with little effort.  Many stat bonuses come with the Esterk, and
its resistances are respectable.  The skills it teaches are nothing new or
particularly useful, though.

Belial		180/50		DeMagic
Molch		230/70		None
Beelzebub	300/0		GigaSlash

PlatKing - The ultimate monster class, PlatKings have low HP, but are
utterly impossible to damage (outside of critical hits).  They learn the
most powerful healing spell, as well as a very powerful all-hitting spell.

Class Effects: None
Stat Adjustments: Str -10%, Agl +20%, Grd +100%, Int -20%, Apr +10%,

Total Battles Required to Master all Master Monster Classes: 650
Total Battles Required to Master all Monster Classes: 6379 (Damn...)
Total Battles Required to Master all Classes: 9977 (Yegadzu!)
Estimated Minimum Number of Dedicated Leveling Hours Needed: 120 (...)

The fastest method to get to the PlatKing is as follows:

Slime -> Lizardman -> DrakSlime -> BoltRat -> BombCrag -> Berserker ->
Dumbira -> Gerion -> Andreal -> Golem -> ProtoMech -> EvilMech ->
Esterk -> PlatKing

You'll need to get a Slime, Lizardman, BoltRat, Dumbira, BombCrag, and
Berserker heart to pull it off.  Whew!  14 monster classes you have to go
through just to get the best monster class...  If you find any of the
higher-level rare hearts along the way for this series, don't hesitate to
use them!  Unlikely though such is, it could be quite helpful if you
somehow did win a Golem or Andreal heart.  Those two alone would reduce
the amount of battles needed by a grotesque amount.

 The PlatKing is a tough one to master, but once it is mastered, you become
literally immune to everything that the enemies in the game can dish out,
and are utterly immortal.  Four PlatKings would be impossible to defeat.
Of course, that would require about 40 hours dedicated to leveling up of
monster classes, but hey, some people have thousands of hours clocked on
RPGs.  I wouldn't be surprised if somebody actually pulled it off...

========================--
Class-Builder's Manifesto				[GMCBMANIF]

 If you want to get as much class leveling as you can, then you need to
minimize experience while maximizing battle count.  This can be difficult,
but it is doable.  The first key to this is learning the Thief's KnockDown
skill, which sets any enemy it hits as having run away.  Enemies that run
away give no experience or gold, meaning you can reduce a fight to one
enemy, kill them, and get a full battle's credit for class-raising with up
to 1/8th the experience you'd get normally.

 Naturally, you'll want to make the best of each battle fought.  If you're
going for hybrid skills, follow the path outlined at the end of the
character class section.  If you're after the Hero class, master Cleric,
Fighter, Paladin, Warrior, Dragoon, Godhand, and Hero, in that order.  The
mastering of Cleric will make you essentially immortal, while the Paladin
class will give you Vaccuum, the first hits-all-enemies no-MP skill you can
get at this point.

 With proper preparation and handling of battles, you can easily gain the
Hero class before you even leave the Dharma Temple in the past.  With
enough patience, you can master all basic classes, learn all hybrid skills,
and get the Hero class before you hit level 24.

Class Development Tips

 There are a lot of classes to choose from, and it's hard to find an ideal
path that suits your style.  Here is my own reccomendation, though.

 First off, find an area where the enemies are reasonably strong, but easy
enough that you can beat them within 2-3 rounds of combat.  If they give
barely any experience, all the better.  Level up your basic jobs against
them, and focus specifically on the path that suits your characters.
Remember, you can't gain experience for a job if the enemy is too weak, so
be sure to go somewhere where they're at least semi-competent.  Check back
with the old woman at Dharma after a few battles to find out if they're
worthy.

 To extend your ability to level up classes in an area, dedicate some time
to the Thief class for at least one character, so you can learn KnockDown.
This skill allows you to get rid of enemies, so they don't give experience,
which is a good thing when leveling classes up.  Be sure that you always
kill at least one enemy per encounter, though, or the battle won't count.
Also, focus on getting some of the more useful hybrid skills early on
(ThiefHit and SwordDanc, especially).  The few extra battles dedicated to
the task will pay off in the long run.

NOTE: I've outlined a path below that will get you every single hybrid
skill (except for LifeDance) as quickly as possible.  This will also net
you just about every ability for all of the basic classes, and make getting
any of the second-tier classes that much easier.  It will take 1231 battles
to finish the whole thing, though (assuming you start this the moment you
can change classes).  For each class, simply fight until you hit class
level 5, or (on the second and third run through a class) fight until you
get the "<character> is making up!" message.

Thief -> Warrior -> Dancer -> Fighter -> Bard -> Cleric -> Mariner ->
Warrior -> Jester -> Mage -> Shepherd -> Bard -> Mage -> Mariner ->
Fighter -> Mage -> Thief -> Cleric -> Shepherd -> Warrior -> Bard ->
Jester -> Thief -> Fighter -> Bard -> Mariner -> Dancer -> Cleric ->
Jester -> Dancer -> Shepherd

BEST CLASSES TO START WITH: Fighter, Cleric, Thief, and Shepherd.  These
four classes have the best line-up of skills early on.  Cleric and Fighter
in particular are the most unbalanced, as Fighters learn many powerful and
useful attack and support abilities, while Clerics learn very effective
healing spells.  And, of course, mastering both allows you to access the
even more unbalanced Paladin class.

SUGGESTED LONG-TERM PATH: Godhand.  Why?  The Godhand class is the easiest
Master class to gain, and nets you a slew of powerful healing and attack
skills (including the absolute best single-enemy attack, UltraHit).  As an
added bonus, you can change classes to Hero after mastering Godhand, thus
making allies even MORE indestructible.  Four Godhand/Hero party members
equals nothing standing a chance against you, believe me.  Even one
Godhand/Hero is more than enough to turn the tide of any battle in your
favor, all the way up to the bonus dungeons.

The Shards and Pedestals				[GMSHARDS]
-----------------------==

 This is fairly simple to explain.  The various sealed lands and locations
in the game can be reached via various pedestals that you find in the
Ancient Fane (as well as two other places).  To complete these pedestals,
you have to find various Shard items (the types are LandShard, FireShard,
AquaShard, WindShard, and ? Shard).  Once you get the shards, you can try
to place them on any pedestal in their respective room (with ? Shards being
a slight exception).  Rotate the pieces with either L or R button, and
place them with X.  Once a piece is placed, it cannot be removed, but it is
also in proper position.  Completing a tablet lets you access a new land or
location.

Map of the Ancient Fane					[GMFANEMAP]

 You spend a lot of time in this place, so it only seems appropriate to
provide a map of the area.

 Note that, until you unseal the appropriate areas, gates won't work.

NOTES: The portal room contains a map of the world in its center.  As you
unseal more lands, you can actually see the map here grow larger.  The
locked grate in the portal room is impossible to open until almost the end
of the game, and the areas beyond it are worthless until you win the game.

                    Outset - The Lone Isle		[D1OUTSET]
                   ==--------------------==

BACK STORY - Estard Island, the only landmass in the entire world.  The
entire island is comprised of two towns, and most everybody knows each
other there.  But some wonder if, perhaps, the world was once a bigger
place, with more lands.  You play the part of a teenage boy living in
Fishbel, the son of the famous fisherman Borkano.  Along with your two best
friends, Kiefer and Maribel, you often end up causing trouble and finding
yourself in awkward situations.  The story begins as a new situation is
about to arise, perhaps the most awkward one yet...

 After choosing New Game from the start-up menu, you'll be presented with
an opening FMV, and soon find yourself standing on the beaches of the town
of Fishbel.  Maribel, a childhood friend, is talking with you, and wants to
know if you're hiding something from her.  Answer however you like (it
doesn't matter what you pick), and head home.  Go upstairs and get in bed,
and a new day will dawn.

Location: Fishbel	Suggested Level: 1
Gold: 3G, 10G, 5G, 10G, 110G, 2G, 1G, 2G, 4G, 3G
Items: Leather Hat, Fish Sub, Herb x2, Hairband, AmitDonut, AmitSnack x2,
FishPaste
General Store: Herb, Antidote, Cloth Shirt, Pot Lid, Stick

 There's plenty to collect around the village, so be sure to break all of
the barrels and look into all of the dressers.  Talking to people can also
be helpful, but if you're just a go-getter player, then you need not worry;
none of the townspeople say anything particularly important.  Head on over
to the ship when you're ready, and down into the main area (handing Borkano
his Fish Sub if you want; the game doesn't seem to care if you don't).
Scour the ship, then go talk to Maribel (who's hiding behind some barrels
in the hold).  Afterwards, talk to the chef.

 Head on back up, and Borkano (rather rudely) shoves you off the ship.
Yeesh, with parents like that...  Anyway, head on back home.  You won't
make it very far, though.  After you're told by a soldier to report to
Estard Castle, Maribel joins your party.  Feel free to chat her ear off, if
you want, but it's really not all that fun... yet.  Once you get some more
party members, chatting with them can be highly entertaining indeed.
Anyway, head back home to grab the FishPaste from Molly (if you'd like;
it's 100% optional), and then it's off to the world map!  The world map's
simple enough to navigate, and Estard Castle is just north of Fishbel,
along the coast.  Head on into town.

Location: Estard	Suggested Level: 1
Gold: 2G, 1G, 6G, 2G, 5G, 2G
Items: Dung, INTseed, AmitDonut, Herb, Antidote, Stick, Spectacle
Equipment Shop: Herb, Cloth Shirt, Pot Lid, Traveler Clothes, HairBand,
Leather Hat
Castle Shop: Antidote, Pole, Stick, Leather Shield, Traveler Clothes

 Estard's significantly bigger than Fishbel, as you may have noticed.
Maribel rushes off to the item shop, leaving you to head up to the castle.
You may want to explore the town a bit first, though, and get all of the
items and gold lying around.  When you're ready, take the northern path
running straight through the village on up to the castle.  Be sure to
search the castle thoroughly before heading up to talk to King Burns, as
well.

 Burns has a brief chat with you concerning Kiefer.  Pushy, isn't he?  When
you're done with the castle, head back to Fishbel.  Head to the harbor, and
talk to the folks around there.  One of them will give you a note from
Kiefer, telling you to meet him at "the usual place".  Hmm...  Head back
home and talk to Mollie, then go north to the Ancient Fane.

Location: Ancinet Fane	Suggested Level: 1
Gold: None
Items: Ancient Scroll

 As you enter the fane, head off to the left, and you'll find Kiefer
standing in front of a statue.  Talk to him, and he'll tell you that he
knows that this statue can be activated somehow, and that he wants your
help in doing so.  After a failed attempt to use the SunStone ring on the
statue, he'll give you the Ancient Scroll, and then head back to Estard.
This scroll is fairly useless to you, but perhaps it would be useful to a
scholar...

Location: Estard
New Items: HotStone, Pearl Orb

 Head back to Estard, and go down below the town to the house out on the
cliff edge (there's a stairwell leading down in one of the corners of
Estard; it's hard to miss).  Give the old man the Ancient Scroll, and he'll
tell you to go away for a while so he can examine it.  Head back upstairs,
making sure to stop by the well for the Pearl Orb, and visit the inn and
Hondara's house to get the HotStone.  This is your only chance to get the
Pearl Orb, so don't skip it if you're a completionist.

 Head back to the ruins, and try either the HotStone or the Pearl Orb on
the statue.  Nothing happens, of course.  But you do find a note from
Kiefer, telling you to go and see him at the castle.  No point in not doing
so.  He'll demand that you take him along to go see the old scholar.  Go
ahead and do just that, and you'll find that the scholar has finished
translating the scroll.  With the proper knowledge of how to activate the
statue in hand, head on outside.  Unfortunately, your quest will have to
wait a day, as Kiefer is spotted by guards, and has to go home.  Do the
same yourself, and sleep it off.

 The next morning (very, very early the next morning), Kiefer (of all
people) wakes you up, and tells you that it's time to get a move on.  With
that loud-mouthed prince in tow, take the trip north to the Ancient Fane,
and go examine the statue that you and Kiefer were putting things on
earlier.  One short scene later, you'll be inside the Ancient Fane.

Location: Ancient Fane	Suggested Level: 1
Gold: 10G
Items: Ancient Key, LifeAcorn, Saint Armor, Saint Sword, Saint Shield,
Saint Helmet, World Map, LandShard x2

 Feel free to read the inscriptions on the floor, if you want.  They
provide a few hints on how to get through this dungeon, as well as some
history of what's up with this place.  Once you're ready, head down into
the Fane proper.

 After several scenes of filler rooms, you'll finally reach a bridge with a
plaque on the far end.  Read it to get a hint about the first puzzle of the
Fane, and then proceed inward.  You'll find yourself in a room with four
statues and a large torch soon enough.  When you do, put out the torch from
the left side (assuming that the camera angle is set so that the door you
entered from is down).  When the statue relights the torch, walk behind it
and hit the switch on the floor.  Now, go into the revealed doorway, and
pick up the Saint Helmet.  One down, three to go!

 Go ahead and enter deeper into the Fane.  You'll see a waterfall here, and
four statues.  If you want, you can use the Saint Helmet on the third
statue now, or you can wait until after you have the other three pieces.
Regardless of your choice, go downstairs.  Here, you'll see a lift, and
several doors.  The goal here is to get through the door that the lift
opens, before the lift goes back up.  To do this, push the blocks onto the
switches so that the doors closest to the wall between the two rooms are
open (I know it sounds strange in text, but it makes sense while you're
looking at it on the TV).  Then, board the lift, and hightail it through
the open doors into the revealed doorway.

 From here, head upstairs, and over to the lion's maw.  Read the plaque if
you want, and then try your hand (no pun intended) at getting what's in the
mouth.  No worries, your hero's not evil.  With the Ancient Key in hand, go
back downstairs, outside, and through the other entrance to this area.  Go
into the doorway (which you can now unlock, thanks to the key), and into
the next puzzle room.  The solution is (literally) printed on the wall, but
if you're not in the mood for puzzle-solving, the answer is to take the
left, right, left, and left forks in the paths ahead.  From here,  continue
into the Fane.

 Before long, you'll find yourself in a room with a dragon statue and a
blue crystal in a claw.  Grab the crystal, go across the bridge, and toss
the crystal into the other claw.  This will change the water levels, giving
you access to the remaining three Saint treasures.  First things first, go
back into the room you came from, and ride the raft out past the island,
into the next area, and grab the treasure chest at the far end.  Then, go
over to the stairway, climb the stairs, and get yet another treasure from
up there.  Only one to go!  Backtrack to the room before the dragon room,
and proceed through the exposed doorway in the area that was previously
flooded.

 This is the final puzzle of the Fane, and it's a no-brainer.  If you want
to solve it without hints, then try that stairway in the middle of the
water back in the previous room.  You can get hints down there.  Anyway,
the answer is to push all of the big blocks except for the Skeleton and
Slime ones onto the switches.  If you get the order wrong, just leave the
room to reset the blocks, and try again.  Your reward is the Saint Armor,
which completes your collection!  Head back upstairs to the waterfall room
to place the armor!

 There's a hint down somewhere in the Fane that tells you exactly where to
put the armor, so if you're roughing it, you'll probably want to seek that
out first.  If not, then here's what to do: place the armor on the first
statue, the shield on the second, helmet on the third, and sword on the
fourth.  The door will open, and you'll be allowed into the hall that leads
to the final puzzle of the Fane.  Feel free to make use of the Adventure
Journal on the pedestal before proceeding.  Enter the cavernous room at the
end of the hall.

 This, the final puzzle, is quite simple.  Grab either of the torches.  Now
then, for those of you roughing it, here's a hint: those two statues each
have gems corresponding to the colors of the torches, and unlit braziers.
For those of you who just want to get this over with, climb the red statue
with the red torch and light it, and do the same with the blue torch and
statue.  Using the hints provided, light the torches accordingly.  Below is
a diagram if you're incredibly lazy and don't want to think this simple
puzzle out.

B = Blue  R = Red  X = No flame

R X R
X B X
B R B

 This will brighten the area up, and open the final doorway.  In here, read
the plaque, then grab the shard.  Now, head either way (right would be
the best choice), and then up and over into the world map room.  Grab the
map, and then make your way to the earth pedestal room (see Fane map at the
start of the guide for details).  Grab the shard there, and then check out
the pedestal closest to where the shard was.  Place your two shards (press
L1 and/or R1 to rotate them, X to place them), and then retreat using O.
Keifer will state the obvious, and then you should leave.  There are two
ways to go about doing this.  One is to backtrack completely through the
Fane.  Not in the mood for all that walking?  Go check out the world map
room, and enter the doorway with the blue flame over it.  Either way,
you'll eventually get back outside.  Head back to Fishbel.

Location: Fishbel
New Items: LandShard

 The Amitt Harvest has begun!  Go and talk to the guy at the dock who is
nearest the ship (but not on it), and he should tell you that they caught
something strange in the fishing net.  Of course, being an RPG, that
something has to be important, right?  Go back home, and talk to Borkano.
After babbling like a fool for a few pages (and revealing an interesting
bit of impossibility about the hero's birth), he'll finally give you the
LandShard, telling you to take it to the king.  Yeah, right!  You can
either go talk to Kiefer in Estard (he'll insist that the two of you take
off for the Ancient Fane ASAP), or just skip that step and go to the Fane
yourself.  Either way, Kiefer and Maribel join your party by the time you
get to the Fane's entrance.

Location: Ancient Fane
New Items: None

 From here, just enter the Fane.  Go back downstairs, through the Fane, and
place that final LandShard on the pedestal.  This is where it all begins...

The Monsters of Rexwood					[D1REXWOOD]
----------------------==

PEDESTAL: Rexwood (Land room, upper left)
PIECES: Ancient Fane (in the main hall), Ancient Fane (found on the ground
near the Rexwood pedestal), Fishbel (received from Borkano)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 3 (this relates to class level limits; don't worry about
it for now)

 Whoo!  What a trip...  Maribel (being her usual dense self) decides to go
off and head home, despite being in a forest that none of the party has
seen before.  Great logic, Maribel...  Anyway, go ahead and follow her.  As
her scream may hint to you, your first battle is approaching.  Keep going
forward, until you catch up with Maribel.  Now, for your first battle,
against the famous jiggly blue Slimes!  They're not too tough, but being
ill-equipped, it could be a fairly long battle.  I doubt you'll lose,
though.  Anyway, after winning, Maribel blames you for bringing her
(typical of her), and demands that you take her home.  My, she is
demanding...

 Keep going onward, and you'll run into a woman putting weeds on some
graves.  The woman will offer to guide you to the nearby town, so go ahead
and accept.  With Matilda in tow, head on out into the world.

Location: Rexwood Island	Suggested Level: 1
Monsters: Slime, Eggplaton, Centbeast

 A note about world maps within the pedestals: there are random monster
encounters, activated as you walk.  Keep near towns until you're confident,
so that you can heal up and restock items.  Dying hardly makes the game
easier, after all.  Anyway, feel free to level up a bit (the only monsters
in the area are Slimes, Centbeats and Eggplatons), and when you're ready,
head on into town.

Location: Rexwood		Suggested Level: 1-3
Gold: 12G
Items: Cloth Shirt
Shop: Herb, Club, Copper Sword, Pole, Horned Hat, Leather Armor,
Leather Shield

 As you step into town, you'll notice a few things.  First off, Matilda has
left the party (that was brief), and second, the town looks like it's in
ruins.  Explore around, and talk to people (if you'd like).  Feel free to
buy some better weapons now (the shop is near the inn), and rest up if
necessary.  You may want to go outside and level up a bit, as well.  When
you feel you are ready, go to the northern end of town, and enter the small
hut on the furthest north end of town.

 The boy in the hut will greet you (his name's Patrick), and beg you to
help his ailing father.  He needs a green Colorstone, but the mines where
the Colorstones are is laden with monsters.  Not a problem for a party of
heroic warriors like your own, but no place for a child like Patrick.
Leave town, and go southwards to the cave.

Location: Colorstone Mine	Suggested Level: 2-4
Monsters: Lipsy, Slime, Centbeast, Eggplaton, TongueRat, CatMage
Gold: 40G
Items: Herb, STRseed, Green Orb, Wood Doll

 The mines are pretty lacking in life.  As the foreman will tell you, the
place has been abandoned due to the monsters.  Go ahead and head on in.
You'll find Matilda just inside, and exchange a few heated words with her
before she leaves.  With that done, walk your way through the mines,
picking up the various treasures, and keep heading downwards.

 On the third floor, you'll encounter your first Colorstone puzzle.  These
nasty little block puzzles require you to shatter various Colorstones
blocking your path, by pushing same-colored stones up against one another.
The puzzles aren't too hard, but they can be grating on the nerves.  Before
long, you'll be on the bottom floor.  The green Colorstone is clearly
visible, glowing faintly.  As you reach the stone, Matilda comes in.  After
a brief conversation, she'll hand you a shard of the Colorstone.  Time to
go back to Patrick!

 Upon returning, Patrick will apply the stone to his father, Hank, and Hank
will revive.  A brief cutscene will ensue, and then you'll need to go back
to Patrick's house and have Hank will join your party.  Then, it's off to
the tower!

Location: Monster Tower		Suggested Level: 4-6
Monsters: *Golem, Slime, Eggplaton, Cactiball, TongueRat, CatMage,
Earwinger, *Clawser
Gold: 20G, 5G, 80G
Items: Herb, WindShard, FireShard, Bronze Knife, Leather Shield, DEFseed

 The entrance to the tower is guarded by a Golem.  Fortunately for you,
Hank alone can handle it.  Unfortunately for you, you have to tag along and
help out during the fight.  Afterwards, you may want to head back to
Rexwood and use the inn, since the Golem packs quite a punch.

 The tower itself is quite straightforward, and more or less symmetrical.
Chances are good that you won't get lost at all.  Do try to collect as many
items as possible from the tower, though.  They come in handy.  Once you
have reached the final area of the tower, you'll have to fight the first
real boss of the game, a beefed-up Clawser.

Boss: Clawser		Suggested Level: 5-6
HP: 400			Item: DEFseed
Strategy: Attack away, and heal as necessary (ie. whenever a character is
two hits away from dying; bosses love focusing on single characters, and
are usually faster than you are).  Clawser, while high on HP, isn't all
that powerful.  FireSlash and Sap are both useful against him, if you have
them.

 After the fight, the story will get a little progression, and you'll have
to fight another boss.

Boss: Matilda		Suggested Level: 5-6
HP: 500
Strategy: Matilda only defends, so just let loose on her.  She'll take a
while to defeat, though.  If you don't feel like fighting, then you can
just run away.

 After the fight, peace has been restored!  Go back to town, pay folks a
visit if you want (certainly you'll want to save), drop Hank off at his
house, and go back to where you first entered this island.  You'll find
Patrick at the graves, which have numerous flowers around them now.  You
can give him the Wood Doll if you want to.  Regardless, head deeper into
the forest, to where you first landed.  There is a portal there now, that
leads back to the Ancient Fane.  Go ahead and jump into it.  Kiefer will
run off, and Maribel will insist that you escort her home.  She's so co-
dependent...  Go ahead and return to Fishbel.

Location: Fishbel

 Maribel runs off as soon as you arrive.  So typical of her.  The talk of
the town is that a new island has appeared!  Go and see Mollie (your
mother) for more information.  Now then, it's off to Estard castle!  If you
want to piss off Maribel (or try to piss her off, at least), go wake her up
first.  Anyway...

Location: Estard
New Items: HolyWater

 Go talk to your uncle Hondara, and say yes twice to get the HolyWater.  It
will come in handy fairly soon.  Trying to go to the castle is futile at
this point, since the gate is up.  Go visit the scholar on the cliff
instead.  Kiefer is outside.  Go ahead and talk to him.  Now, go back to
Fishbel, and find the cave along the coast.  Kiefer and Maribel are waiting
for you there.  Go ahead and lift the stone lid, head down below, and get
your very own sailing vessel!  Now you can sail to the island!  As you
arrive, you may get a sensation of deja vu...  Go ahead and enter the
village.

Location: Rexwood
Gold: 25G
Items: WindShard, AGLseed, Leather Hat, Antidote, Herb
Shop: Antidote, Copper Sword, Mallet, Horned Hat, Leather Armor,
Leather Shield, Traveler Clothes

 Yep, you're back!  But Rexwood is completely different.  But that's to be
expected, since it's been a few centuries.  Visit around, and be sure to
get the shard here.  Looks like you can find more shards in the colorstone
mines, so you might as well pay them a visit.

Location: Colorstone Mines
Gold: 13G
Items: Antidote, MysticNut, FireShard

 Nothing has changed, except the people.  Go ahead and go into the depths
of the mines.  There are more puzzles now, and they're more devious.  Of
course, that's not saying much.  Get the shard on the bottom floor (which
wasn't there in the past; the shard is upwards, when viewed from the
default camera angle), then get the heck out of there.  Hightail it back to
Estard.

Location: Estard Castle
New Items: AGLseed, FireShard

 Go and talk to the guards near the castle gates to get in.  Now, make your
way upstairs, outside, up the stairs into the doorway on the right, and
down two levels.  Sounds confusing, right?  You'll figure it out.  Anyway,
the old man from the cliff is there, and you should help him through.  Go
and follow him.  Talk to both the old man and the captain, then board the
raft.  The entrance you're looking for is at the back of the castle.  Go
around to the other side of the castle, disembark, and go below the balcony
in the rear.  Enter the doorway, and head downstairs twice.  The shard is
hidden behind the bookcase down here.  Check it, then grab the shard from
the chest.  Return to the captain and old man, and talk to them.  Now, it's
time to return to the Fane!  Place the FireShards in the upper left fire
pedestal, and off you go to the land of Engow!


Engow and the Volcano					[D1ENGOW]
--------------------==

PEDESTAL: Engow (Fire room, upper left)
PIECES: Rexwood Tower (in a chest), Estard (in the basement of the castle),
Colorstone Mines (present; found on the ground on the bottom floor)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 6

Location: Engow Island		Suggested Level: 5-7
Monsters: CatMage, Swordaroo, Forester, Florajay, TongueRat

 After an FMV (quite a rarity in this game), you'll find yourself on the
island of Engow.  From here, it's a long walk to the village, but what
choice do you have?

Location: Engow			Suggested Level: 6-8
Gold: 10G, 6G
Items: LifeAcorn, Antidote x2, Cloth Shirt, Horned Hat
Shop: Herb, Antidote, Copper Sword, Mallet, Rosevine, Leather Dress,
Leather Shield, Scale Shield

 Just a quick note: don't visit the village elder until you're happy with
your current level and equipment, as once you do, staying at the inn will
cause the plot to move forward.  Once you are ready, go talk to him.  Now,
go stay at the inn.  The next morning, Pamela (the local seer) is causing a
bit of a panic with a prophecy.  Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  Remember the
FMV?  After the cutscene, go upstairs and watch another one.  Now, go and
see Pamela.  She's a woman with a plan, as you can see.  Say yes to her
twice, and she'll advise you stay at the inn.  Save up, and if you have any
leveling you want to do before the festival begins, go do it now.  Stay at
the inn once you are certain that you're ready.

 The festival starts!  It's pretty boring so far, huh?  Incidentally, if
you're wondering where all the shop goods from above were earlier, they're
being offered now.  Anyway, go talk to the mayor to get things moving.
Answer his question however you like, and then go see Pamela.  She gives
you a low-down on the basic plan, and tells you to go enjoy the festival.
Apparently, time flows quickly here, because the Procession of Fire is
already about to start.  Go talk to the mayor to get a torch, tell him yes,
then watch what follows.  Go to the mountain, and talk to the guy at the
top of the procession.  Once you can, say yes, then go find Pamela.  She's
on the other side of the crater.  Talk to her, go inside the volcano and
return, then have her save your game. Now, to descend into the depths of
this firepit!

Location: Mt. Flame		Suggested Level: 7-8
Monsters: Florajay, Earwinger, Forester, Swordaroo, Thornmole, Imp, Babble
Gold: 110G
Items: STRseed, Herb, Antidote, DEFseed, Knife

 The path is pretty straightforward, and your goal is always to fall down
further into the crater.  To actually reach the crater itself, though, is a
bit of a trek.  It's really not worth listing here, save that you should go
upwards once you reach the first fork in the volcano.  Once you reach the
bottom (there's a healing light two levels before it, which you should
probably use), you have to kill the FireGiant.

Boss: FireGiant		Suggested Level: 7-9
HP: 400			Item: AquaShard
Strategy: FireGiant is vulnerable to Sleep, so you can make the battle much
easier by having Maribel use that on him whenever he's awake.  FireSlash
and Blaze have no effect on this bad boy, so regular attacks, Sleep, and
Sap are all you can use to affect him.  Be sure to keep up on healing, as
the boss can easily kill you if your HP drops below about 22.  The fight,
though annoyingly long, is not difficult.

 After the fight, go past where the pot was, and dive into the hole.  Now,
go on back to the top of the volcano.  The black flame looms large, but you
already have a way to extinguish it!  Talk to Pamela, and say yes.  Use the
HolyWater on the black flame, and say goodbye to it!  After the cutscenes
end, you're free to return to the regular world.  First, though, you should
go and visit the elder and Pamela again.  Pamela gives you an AquaShard, so
don't miss it!  Anyway, now you should return to the Ancient Fane, and head
back outside.  Before you leave the cave, though, go fill the Bottle you
now have left over from the HolyWater with water from the bay.  You can
reach the bay from the cave where the blue flame doorway teleports you.
RainbwDew in hand, return to the world map.

 Your boat has vanished, but that's okay.  Just go visit Estard, and return
to the castle.  Go and see Kiefer's father.  King Burns seems to have
caught onto what's going on.  Things get a bit ugly, and before long,
Borkano will be asking if you still plan to adventure.  Tell him yes (of
course), two times, then go to bed.  The next morning, head to the cave in
the back of Fishbel.  Maribel will force her way back into the party again
(doesn't matter what you say to her), but then, what's wrong with more
allies?  In the cave, try and move the stone plate.  Too heavy?  No
problem, Kiefer's here to help!  Go back outside and talk to him, and he'll
rejoin the party.  Now, it's time to explore the present version of Engow!

Location: Engow
Gold: 7G
Items: Button, TinyMedal, Potion, Antidote x2, Cloth, Boxer Shorts
Shop: Mallet, Rosevine, Scale Armor, Leather Dress, Leather Shield,
 Scale Shield, Wooden Hat

 The town looks pretty much the same.  Go talk to the kid in the upper
right corner of town, then go see the current Pamela.  Now, go check out
the Inn sign, and talk to the kid again and say yes for your first
TinyMedal.  Then, grab all of the stuff in town, and visit the volcano.

Location: Mt. Flame		Suggested Level: 8-9
Monsters: Same as in past
Gold: 60G, 80G, 350G
Items: Antidote, Herb, WindShard

 The volcano hasn't changed, either.  Except for the warp point near the
lip of the volcano, of course.  That warp point will take you back to the
Ancient Fane, so feel free to use it when you're done here.  Be sure to
explore it thoroughly, as there is that shard in here to get.  Once you've
gotten every item you're after here, go pay the Ancient Fane another visit,
and check out the upper left pedestal in the Aqua room.


Stone Rain and Lost Hope				[D1DIALAC]
-----------------------==

PEDESTAL: Dialac (Aqua room, upper left)
PIECES: Engow (Pamela gives it to you after the celebrations are over)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 9

Location: Dialac Island		Suggested Level: 8-9
Monsters: Thornmole, Centbeast, Earwinger, CancerMan

 As you step out of the portal, you'll notice that you're on a very tiny
island, with only one very small town on it.  As you head into town, you
may notice that something is seriously wrong here...

Location: Dialac		Suggested Level: 8-9
Gold: 10G, 7G, 5G
Items: Leather Hat, Cloth Shirt, AngelTear, Herb, LandShard

 Yes, the town's people have indeed been turned to stone.  Look around, and
be sure to go pay a visit to the old man near the well.  He'll tell you to
leave, but what respectable adventurer would do THAT in this kind of
situation?  He also gives you the AngelTear, though you can't use it just
yet.  Go stay at the inn (it's free, obviously), and you'll be woken up in
the middle of the night.  Now, you have a short pseudo-quest to go on:
finding out what happened to Dialac!  Talk to all of the statues to get the
full story, and be sure to explore every nook and cranny thouroughly.  If
you want, you can go talk to the old man by the well.  When you're done,
head back to bed.

 Come morning time, it'll be time to ponder the clues you've uncovered.
There's one statue that wasn't anywhere to be found, and that was the young
boy...  His note said that he had two hideouts, and if you read his note,
you'll know that one of his hideouts is buried near the small markings on
the cliff on the left side of town (assuming you keep the rotation at
default viewpoint).  Head over there, and dig open the path to the old
base.

 Go on down into the base, and climb your way through the tunnels below it
to the big rock in the center of town.  From up there, you should be able
to hit everything in town with the AngelTear, so go ahead and use it.
March your way on down the rope and up through his base to meet the kid,
then take him to old the man... er, the old man (after you've gotten the
LandShard from his base, of course).  Your task here is done, so it's time
to go back to the present.

Location: Empty Field
Items: WindShard
Gold: None

 Head to where Dialac was in the past.  You'll see that now it's just a big
empty field with that rock in it.  An old man there tells you that he wants
to make it a town again, but he needs people to move there if he's going to
do that.  You'll also find a critical WindShard there, which will allow you
to reach Orph.  You can help old man Sim build up his town if you'd like.
See my guide at the end of the walkthrough on populating the immigrant
town for details.  You should also look there for a list of the items that
appear in the various forms of the town.  Anyway, head back to the Ancient
Fane, and unlock Orph.


The Curse of Orph					[D1ORPH]
----------------==

PEDESTAL: Orph (Wind room, upper left)
PIECES: Rexwood Tower (the Golem drops it), Rexwood (present; given to you
by an irate woman), Mt. Flame (present; found in a chest on B1F), Empty
Field (lying on the ground)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 12

Location: Orph Area		Suggested Level: 8-9
Monsters: Babble, Swordaroo, Imp, CancerMan, Thornmole, TongueRat

 Welcome to Orphie... er, Orph.  The town is a bit to the north, so that's
where you should be headed.

Location: Orph
Gold: 5G, 5G
Items: Herb, DEFseed, HairBand, LifeAcorn, Copper Sword, TinyMedal, Bone
Knife, Antidote, Dung
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent
Equipment Shop: Bone Knife, Mallet, Rosevine, Cloth, Leather Shorts, Scale
Armor, Kitten Shield, Wooden Hat

 As you may have noticed, there are a lot of animals here.  Indeed, there
are even animals in the shops, running them!  Yes, you can shop with the
animals still, and you can stay at the inn.  And the humans all seem to be
unable to speak.  Hmm...  Visit the shed near the rear of town, then go
back to the present (after looting the town and checking every building),
and retreive the woodcutter.  His house is west of Fishbel.

Location: Woodsman's House
Gold: 3G
Items: MysticNut, Cloth, Herb, MysticNut*

(NOTE: A * indicates that an item is in a locked chest.  To unlock them,
you need the Thief Key, which won't be available until several areas from
this point.)

 Grab the stuff (if you're wondering, the MysticNut is in the hands of a
squirrel in the back yard; say yes to the animal to get it), then go talk
to the woodcutter.  He'll tag along.  Head back to Orph, and have him talk
to the animals.  Okay, that didn't work, so try talking to the humans.
Talk to all of them to get the full story of what's going on here.  Also,
be sure to free the boy that's chained in the stable.  Now, head to Mt.
Ceide!  It's just a bit north and far west of Orph.

Location: Mt. Ceide		Suggested Level: 8-10
Monsters: Crestpent, FairyRat, SkyHunter, TailApe, CancerMan, Venomworm,
Goopi, Babble, Healer
Gold: 120G
Items: AquaShard x2, STRseed

 The mountain is very easy to navigate.  A walkthrough is entirely
unnecessary for it.  Eventually, you'll reach the cave on the far side of
the mountain.  Heal outside of the cave blocked by the stone slab, and then
enter.  Go upstairs, and try to go as far into the room as you can.  This
will trigger the next (required) boss fight.  Before you do this, though,
put Kiefer in the first character position, the hero in the second, and
Maribel in the third.  This will cause Kiefer to take the majority of the
hits, which is good, since he can absorb a lot of damage before he goes
down.

Boss: Deathpal		Suggested Level: 9-11
HP: 350
Strategy: DO NOT USE MAGIC!  There is a seal on magic here, meaning that
you can only rely on Kiefer's FireSlash, regular attacks, and herbs for
healing.  The fight is very long, as a result.  As an added pain in the
arse, Deathpal likes to focus on attacking one character relentlessly, so
you can expect to be redoing this fight many, many times if you want to win
with all party members alive.  Don't rely on the Woodsman for healing,
either; he's unpredictable at best.  Follow the usual "heal at two hits
from death" rule for the safest path to victory.  If you feel lucky, have
Maribel use Retaliate and hope she gets hit by WindBeast.

 After the fight, Deathpal will be resealed.  Serves him right, the jerk.
Head back to Orph, and talk to the townspeople (particularly the farmer in
the shed).  After talking to the afformentioned farmer, the woodsman and
Gabo will appear, and take off for the gate back to the present.  Once
you've gotten everything in town that you need, follow them back to the
gate, and on through.  Gabo will now join you.  Now you should make your
way back to Orph and Mt. Ceide, but this time, in the present.  I actually
suggest that you go to Mt. Ceide first.

Location: Mt. Ceide
Monsters: Same as in past
Gold: 120G
Items: Stone Claw, TinyMedal, Bunny Ears, AquaShard

 Go on through, grab the stuff in the mountain, and reawaken Deathpal.  He
is now just an ordinary human, so he can't cause you trouble.  He'll give
Gabo the ability to speak (on accident, mind you), and hand you the final
shard necessary to unlock Falrod.  Well, that was nice of him.  Time to go
and visit Orph now.

Location: Orph
Gold: 30G, 15G, 5G
Items: WindShard, Herb, Cloth Shirt, DEFseed, Monster Manual
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent
Equipment Shop: Knife, Stone Claw, Rosevine, Cloth, Leather Pants,
Kitten Shield, Fur Hat, Turban

 Don't panic, it's not what it looks like.  Go visit the elder's house, and
you'll see that the people are, in fact, celebrating a festival, and are
all in costume.  Go ahead and join in on the festivities.  There will be a
contest, where you have to pick out the women in the crowd.  The women are
disguised as a cow, a horse, and a dog.  Since there are two cows, figure
out which of them is a woman first.  You have as many tries as you need, so
don't worry if you fail a time or two.  The reward is the Monster Manual,
which shows you every enemy you've fought, and their various animations.
It also allows you to instantly escape any battle with any monster that you
have fought 999 or more of, simply by pressing O during that battle.

 With Orph and Ceide behind you, you can now return to the Ancient Fane, if
you wish.  You could check out the docks to the west of Orph, but there's
nothing worthwile there (unless you call 15G worthwhile).  Anyway, do as
you wish, then return to the Fane and unseal Falrod.


Falrod and the MechSoldiers				[D1FALROD]
--------------------------==

PEDESTAL: Falrod (Aqua room, upper right)
PIECES: Mt. Ceide (past; in a treasure chest on the second floor), Mt.
Ceide (past; found in a treasure chest on the fifth floor), Mt. Ceide
(present; given to you by Deathpal), Mt. Flame (won from the FireGiant)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 15

Location: Falrod Area		Suggested Level: 9-11
Monsters: ClockMech, CancerMan, Crestpent, Goopi, VenomWorm, RedSlime,
Meranza, TailApe

 This is a pretty big chunk of land, and it's easy to get lost on it, so
you'll want to keep track of where you're going.  Your goal is to the east,
and then south around the mountains.  What you're looking for is a town.

Location: Falrish
Gold: 10G, 15G, 3G
Items: TinyMedal, Leather Armor, STRseed, FireShard, Herb
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent
Weapon Shop: Mallet, Rock Axe, Iron Spear, Stone Claw, Boomerang
Armor Shop: Leather Dress, Scale Armor, Shell Clothes, Chain Armor,
Bronze Shield, Kitten Shield, Iron Helm, Silver Tiara

 Welcome to your new base of operations.  Now would be a good time to get
some leveling up out of the way, so that you're at least the maximum
suggested level for the area.  The upshot of doing this is that you'll be
able to afford new equipment (which is obscenely expensive in this game,
for some unknown reason), and you could even potentially win an Iron Axe
(or two, if you're unholy-lucky) from the ClockMech enemies.  I'm advising
that you do this now, as you won't get a better opportunity to do so.  Once
you're satisfied with your level and equipment, visit the barracks of
Falrish and see the captain leave for the castle (if you haven't already),
talk to the people down there, then head for Falrod Castle (which is
further west).

Location: Falrod Castle		Suggested Level: 11-13
Gold: 5G
Items: Leather Shield, Scale Armor, TinyMedal, DEFseed, STRseed

 Go into the righthand guard house, and sell your services as a mercenary.
Agree to show them your strength, and defeat the Falroider.  Now you're a
mercenary for Falrod.  Go ahead and loot the castle now, and once you're
done, visit the king.  He'll assign you to Captain Trad, who tells you to
go to the guardhouse for a strategy meeting.  Go and do that.  Talk to Trad
to commence the meeting, then talk to everybody else, and return to Trad.
He'll leave the guardhouse.  Talk to Hanes.  He'll ask you to go see Zebbot
on behalf of the castle.  Go ahead and do that.

Location: Zebbot's House
Gold: 2G
Items: Bronze Knife, SeaShell Hat, Bone Knife

 It's not much, is it?  Grab the stuff lying around, then go see Zebbot.
He's a cold-hearted bastard, isn't he?  Go back to the castle, and tell
Hanes the truth.  Agree to do guard duty, then leave the guardhouse and go
to the tower (the one above the guardhouse).  It seems that a soldier has
returned.  Go down through the hole in the floor to the guardhouse.
Trad asks you to take him to see Zebbot.  Do so.  It seems that Zebbot is
cold to everybody, even authority.  As you leave, you'll see a defective
MechSoldier appear.  Trad decides to help Zebbot research the MechSoldier,
and orders you to return to the castle.

 Go back to Falrod, go into the castle, then exit.  You'll have to fight a
few Clockmechs, but they're (relatively) easy to kill.  After a brief bit
of oddness, go to the front of the castle to see what happened.  Talk to
Zebbot, and then agree to Trad's plan of a strategy meeting.  After the
night's rest, go see Trad and Zebbot in the barracks.  Then, tell Hanes in
the guardhouse to start the meeting.  He'll ask you to go get Trad, so do
just that.  Now, back to the guardhouse (notice a trend here?), and the
meeting will begin once you talk to Trad.  The plan is simple: disrupt the
guards at the MechSoldier base, then sneak in and kill their leader.  Trad
will tell you to go see him when you're ready.  He's in the barracks, and
unless you have something you forgot to do, you might as well go and tell
him that you're ready now.  Exit the castle and re-enter it to see the
departure scene.  Talk to every person there, then to Trad.  Go meet him
(and save) at Falrish (he's in the barracks below the church), then head
for the MechSoldier base (which is east-northeast of Falrish).

Location: MechSoldier Base	Suggested Level: 11-14
Monsters: Clockmech, FairyRat, Babygoyle, Hork
Gold: 250G, 100G
Items: FireShard, Iron Shield, STRseed (1 Cannibox)

 Try to enter the path down to the base, and you'll meet up with Zebbot and
Trad.  Eri will start the distortion wave, and the path to the base will be
left open!  The base is a very simple dungeon, and an in-depth walkthrough
really isn't required.  Don't be shy about talking to the MechSoldiers in
the base, most of them are defective and some will even help you get to
various items.  Anyway, once you reach the end of the base, you'll have to
face off a pseudo-boss (Machinoid), who should not prove difficult.  After
that, though, you have to battle EvilMech.

BOSS: EvilMech		Suggested Level: 12-14
HP: 500
Strategy: Keep your HP up above all else.  EvilMech can take two turns, and
has quite a few dangerously powerful attacks, so do not slack off on
recovering from the damage.  The fight will be long as a result, but that's
pretty normal for this game.  Take the usual precautions (Sap, FireSlash,
Upper on Maribel), and you should be able to make it through... assuming
your level is high enough, that is.  EvilMech often succumbs to Gabo's
Bark, so feel fee to use that to make the fight a tad bit easier.

 With EvilMech's defeat, the MechSoldiers are now all disabled (though only
according to the plot; they're still as annoying as ever in battle).  Grab
every item still lying around, and then return to Falrod Castle.  If you
want, you can stop by Falrish before that, and see a scene with Zebbot and
Eri.  Talk to the king, and he'll give you the Bug Knife.  Pay one last
visit to Trad and Zebbot, and to Hanes for your pay of 1200G, then head
back to the present. Now, to visit the modern Falrish and Falrod!

Location: Falrish
Gold: 3G, 21G, 210G*
Items: Tights, TinyMedal (1 EvilPot)
Weapon Shop: Copper Sword, Mallet, Rock Axe, Rosevine Whip, Stone Claw,
Iron Spear
Armor Shop: Leather Dress, Scale Armor, Shell Clothes, Chain Armor,
Bronze Shield, Iron Shield, Iron Helmet

 The town is more or less unchanged.  Nobody seems to remember anything
about the MechSoldiers, but that's more or less to be expected.  Collect
the items in town, then head for the castle.

Location: Falrod Castle
Gold: 2G, 8G, 5G
Items: Scale Armor, Noble Clothes, TinyMedal, Herb, WindShard

 The castle also remains more or less unchanged.  Check the old barracks to
see what they're working on now.  Go see the king to find out the situation
first-hand.  After talking to him, he takes off for Zebbot's.  Before you
follow him, get everything in the castle.  Once he's left, talk to Armand.
Then head for Zebbot's home.

Location: Zebbot's House
Items: TinyMedal, FireShard, HairBand

 Even after centuries, the place still looks the same.  Pretty impressive,
really.  Get the stuff here, and pay Eri a visit.  She's still tending to
Zebbot, even though he's a skeleton now.  Exit the cabin, and you'll run
into the king.  Follow him after he takes Eri, back to the castle.  Go up
to the throne room and watch as Armand tries to stop the king.  Well, that
went over like a lead balloon.  You won't have much better luck with him,
so go see Armand instead (he's in the basement of the castle).  He'll ask
you to go get some spare MechSoldier parts from Eri, by way of asking his
granddaughter in Falrish where they are.  Go do that.

 His granddaughter is the little girl in the corner-shaped wall.  She tells
you to go look under the barrel on the other side of town.  That's pretty
easy to reach; just go through the barracks, and outside to the small
island of sorts where the fort meets the stream.  The parts are under the
barrel.  MechParts in hand, bring them back to Armand.  He'll join you.
Now, go into the barracks, and repair Eri.  The overly trusting lookout
will leave you in charge of keeping an eye on Eri.  Silly fool.  After a
short cutscene, everything will be set right.  How touching.  Be sure to go
see Armand's granddaughter for another FireShard, then head for the modern
version of the MechSoldier base.

Location: MechSoldier Base
Items: STRseed, TinyMedal, Iron Claw, (1 Cannibox, 1 EvilPot)

 You may have noticed a trend with this area, in that nothing has really
changed.  Get everything in the base, then go cross the bridge to the coral
temple.  There's nothing there yet, but you might as well visit.  Head on
back to the Ancient Fane, and go to Verdham.


The Tragedy of Verdham					[D1VERDHAM]
---------------------==

PEDESTAL: Verdham (Fire room, lower right)
PIECES: Falrish (past; in the chest in the main storeroom beneath the
stairs), Mechsoldier Base (past; in a chest in the boss room), Zebbot's
Cabin (present; in a chest in the shed behind the house), Falrish (present;
given to you by Armand's granddaughter after helping Armand)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 18

Location: Verdham Area		Suggested Level: 12-14
Monsters: Crestpent, Goopi, Venomworm, Meranza, FairyRat, Babygoyle, Hork

 Fortunately, it's not a long trip to Verdham from where the portal drops
you off.  Take the short hike on east and then north to town.

Location: Verdham
Gold: 25G, 3G, 500G*
Items: Glam Clothes, Wooden Hat, Traveler Clothes, TinyMedal, Bunny Ears
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent
Equipment Shop: Leather Whip, Boomerang, Blade Boomerang, Iron Spear,
Bronze Armor, Iron Shield, Iron Helmet

 Something is definitely wrong here, and I'm sure you know what.  Very
fortunately, it hasn't been fifty-odd years (more like a few hours, from
the looks of it), so you can still ressurect everybody.  Go up to the top
of the big mansion in the central area of town.  There's a TongueRat clone
up here who's caused this trouble.  Kill the little bastard (he's not even
worth calling a boss, he's so easy), and then use the AngelTear.  Now, for
a bit of a mini-drama!  You can take the time to collect the items in town
as you complete the quest here.

 Your first stop in the re-awakened town is outside, in the garden of the
house that you used the AngelTear from.  You'll have to take the rear
entrance, where Iwan is waiting.  Talk to Iwan, and he'll go inside the
garden.  Follow him and talk to him.  Agree to help with Pepe.  Now, return
to the mansion and talk to Borlock.  Next, go upstairs and eavesdrop on
Kaya and Iwan.  The plot thickens.  Iwan went to Linda's home (in the item
shop), but why bother going to see him?  Go upstairs instead, and talk to
Linda.  Leave her home, and follow her to Pepe's.  Talk to her twice, and
talk to Pepe's father.  The hints are a bit vague about this, but you need
to go back to Engow (the past version), and have Pamela give you the
special potion.  It's a bit of a trek, but what choice do you have?

 In Engow, go visit the mayor's house (Pamela is there right now).  Tell
her what's transpired, then get the special potion from her.  Mila Drug in
hand (shouldn't that be Mela Drug, short for Pamela?), return to Verdham.
Go administer it to Pepe.  Now, head for the herb garden, talk to
everybody, and then go outside the fence and see a scene between Kaya and
Pepe.  Hmm...  Return to the party, and talk to Borlock.  Then, watch the
amusing cutscene.  People can be so paranoid...  Go around back, and watch
as Pepe and Linda part.  Can we say "star-crossed lovers"?  Poor sops.  Now
she hates him.  Anyway, Pepe is at the entrance of town, so go talk to him.
What a coward.  Oh well.  The next day, save and head to the Swamp Cave to
the north.

Location: Swamp Cave		Suggested Level: 12-14
Monsters: Hork, Babygoyle, Fuga, MudDoll
Gold: 50G
Items: WindShard x2, TinyMedal, (2 Cannibox)

 The cave is quite straightforward, and the reward at the end is a battle
with Cavemon and two JewelBags.  Take out the JewelBags first, as they can
do all sorts of annoying things to you.  As always, put healing above doing
damage, because a dead party is not very effective.  Standard boss tactics
(Sap on Cavemon, Upper on Maribel, relentless use of FireSlash, healing
at the two-hits-to-death mark, etc.) should see you through.  Once you've
collected the shards in this cave (as well as everything else), you're free
to return to the present.  Go ahead and visit Verdham.

Location: Verdham Ruins
Items: WindShard

 Well, it's not exactly Verdham any more, is it?  Though there is a
WindShard lying here, so don't skip it.  Since it's pretty much dead, go
visit the Forgotten Inn (to the north), and Mentare, which is further east.

Location: Forgotten Inn
Items: TinyMedal

 Not much here, but there is a TinyMedal to get.  You can talk to the man
in the basement to find out more about the legend of the Demon Lord and
God, too.  Once you're done here, go to Mentare.

Location: Mentare
Gold: 3G, 250G, 5G
Items: Slime Earrings, Garter, LandShard
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent, BugPowder, SpiderWeb,
BunnyTail

 Now this is a truly impressive garden.  Grab everything here, then pay a
visit to the monestary.  Unfortunately, you have to go up a long path to
reach it.

Location: Geionne Path
Gold: 100G
Items: TinyMedal, Dung, Horned Hat, LifeAcorn*

 The path is annoying, but there's stuff to get on it, so be sure to do
just that.

Location: Geionne Monestary
Items: DEFseed, Fur Hat

 The monestary is nothing special, but there is free stuff here, and a free
inn.  On a side note, you may notice the two super-sized graves up in the
corner of the monestary.  Hmm...  Anyway, make your way back to the Ancient
Fane, and release the Dejan's area from its seal.



                Act II - Ressurection of the Hero
               ==-------------------------------==

The Deja's Sacred Mission				[D1DEJA]
------------------------==

PEDESTAL: Dejans (Wind room, lower left)
PIECES: Orph (present; in a chest in the weapon shop), Falrod (present; in
a chest in the dungeon), Swamp Cave (past; in a chest on B2F), Swamp Cave
(past; on the ground on B4F)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 21

Location: Dejan Area		Suggested Level: 13-15
Monsters: Babygoyle, DarkDwarf, DrakSlime, Hunter

 There's a lot of nothing on this continent, as you can see.  Go and find
the Dejan's camp, which is in a forest canyon nearby.

Location: Dejan Camp
Gold: 13G, 20G, 5G
Items: Leather Hat, AquaShard, TinyMedal, DEFseed

 Sounds lively here.  Raid the open tents, then talk to the guy guarding
the main tent.  Go take a walk around, talk with the people, and before you
know it, the ceremony will complete.  Just talk to the guy guarding the
tent once you've talked to everybody else.  The chief acts like he suspects
you to be monsters, but he's just playing with you.  You can save your game
via the chief.  Talk to the people in the tent, get the stuff, then go
outside.  The party will split up for the time being.  Go talk to Layla to
get things moving again (she's in the tent near Kiefer).  Go outside, then
go get some Viva Grape, as Kiefer asks.  Give it to him, then go and talk
to both Layla and Kiefer.  Jann will come in and ask a rather amusing
question.  Answer however you want (it won't change anything, but saying
"Yes" has much funnier results).

 You'll be woken up around midnight, so go talk to Kiefer outside.  After
that, some story scenes will commence.  Leave the camp, and head for the
tunnel.  It's north and west of the camp.  First, though, stop by the
temple halfway there.  You can save, and get your HP and MP restored (just
talk to the cat).  Good thing, too.  Heal up, save, and then continue
onwards to the tunnel.

Location: Tunnel/Second Camp
Monsters: MudDoll, ZombieEye, Babygoyle
Items: AGLseed

 The tunnel is very short, fortunately, so you can get through it without
encountering a single enemy.  There are no items in the tunnel, though.
The AGLseed is in the camp.  Anyway, go into the tents, and tell the woman
who's standing up in one of them that you're ready to rest.  Now, head out
of the camp, and south to the sacred lake.

Location: Sacred Lake
Monsters: Crestpent, Smoocher, Hunter, MudDoll, MagJaguar
Gold: 5G, 15G, 20G, 3G, 15G
Items: TinyMedal x2, Bug Knife, Fur Dress, Herb, INTseed, Potion,
 MysticNut, Wizard Ring, LandShard, DEFseed

 As you can see, the temple is in the lake.  Kinda disturbing scenery, but
what can you do?  Go talk to the people wandering around.  It seems that
nobody knows how to get inside the temple.  Whoops!  Go and rest up in the
tent.  Now, leave the tent, and Jann will join you.  Now you can explore
the sacred Lake Altar Cave.  A walkthrough is really not necessary, at
least, not for the first part.  There are a few hidden paths, so be sure to
walk along the edges of every wall (particularly the east wall behind the
stairs up to the flooded floor, and the east wall near the large tablet
that's near where the room full of pits drops you).  The second area has a
minor puzzle.  You have to take the paths that have no treasure chest in
front of them.  You can still open the chests, of course, and you can
actually find an extra one if you continue down the most chest-lined path.
In the next area, Jann solves the puzzle for you.  Let Jann place the
TerraBell on the altar.  This will drain the lake, and open the path
forward (as well as allowing you to get the remaining treasures of the
cave).  The path out to the (now drained) lake is through the room which
was previously flooded.

 Somehow, everybody else got down here before you.  Go talk to Baretta,
check the plaque, then head inside.  Jann grabs the stuff, and just then,
Kiefer returns.  Just in time, too!  Now, go outside and witness the second
(and practically the last) FMV of the game.  After the cinematics and the
ensuing cutscene, you're told to refill the lake by getting the TerraBell.
Do so.  A few cutscenes later, you'll be in a tent.  Exit, and watch.  Talk
to Kiefer, then to him again to get him to follow you back to the gate.
You don't have to do this, but you can remove everything from him; he's
going to give it all back to you anyway.  Head to the gate, and say goodbye
to your best party member.

 You'll receive Kiefer's items, as well as a letter, which basically states
what you already knew.  Well, at least he didn't keep the stuff you gave
him.  Go back to where the Dejans were, but this time in the present.  Not
too surprisingly, they are nowhere to be found.  There is a new spot
nearby, though.  Go ahead and check that out.

Location: Excavation Site
Gold: 17G
Items: AquaShard, TinyMedal

 Some rip-off merchant is charging 5G for entrance, but that's pocket
change.  Tell him "No" to get in for free.  Go inside, and check stuff out.
That's one big skull.  Go outside and collect the other items.  With that
done, now would be as good a time as any to go and see King Burns about
Kiefer.  He'll give you a little spiel about how his son is ignorant, then
give you that critical last Shard.  Now it's time to continue your quest.
Head back to the Ancient Fane, and on to Dharma.


The Legendary Dharma Temple				[D1DHARMA]
--------------------------==

PEDESTAL: Dharma (Aqua room, lower left)
PIECES: Deja camp (past; in a basket), Archeological dig site (in a
dresser), Estard (King Burns gives it to you)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 24

Location: Dharma Area		Suggested Level: 13-15
Monsters: FairyRat, DrakSlime, SlimeNite, MagJaguar, PodHero, PodFightr,
PodMage, PodPriest

 Northeast of the portal, you'll see a building.  Go ahead and check it
out, you won't regret it.

Location: Last Inn
Gold: 3G
Items: AGLseed, BunnyTail*, Iron Shield*
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, Repellent, Slime Earrings, BunnyTail
Equipment Shop: Sickle, Leather Whip, Blade Boomerang, Iron Spear,
Chain Armor, Fur Robe, Slime Clothes

 This place is sort of the final refuge along the road to Dharma.  The inn
is very affordable, and there's even the first casino in the game down in
the well.  Feel free to take some time gaining money and tokens down there,
or simply rest up and move on.  Follow the curve of the mountains as they
turn north, west, and finally south to the Dharma Temple.

Location: Dharma Temple		Suggested Level: 13-16
Gold: 130G, 50G
Items: STRseed

 Feel free to explore a bit, and pick up the various items lying around
here.  The place certainly seems dead, doesn't it?  Head on up to the high
priest, and he'll offer to change your class.  Hmm...  Pick one, and he'll
tell you to bathe in the spring behind him.  Something seems a bit fishy
about that, doesn't it?  I mean, seriously, doing that every time you
change your class would get old fast...  But oblige him, since you can't
advance the plot otherwise.  Much as you may have predicted, it's a trap
(no Admiral Ackbar references, please).  Now, on to the most annoying
sequence and almost the longest of the game, the quest to return to and
re-take Dharma.

Location: Penal Colony
Gold: 3G, 5G, 20G, 30G
Items: Dung x2, Herb x3, Bone Knife, Antidote x2, WorldLeaf, LifeAcorn,
Horned Hat, TinyMedal x2
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent, Thief Key
Weapon Shop: Hammer, Iron Claw, Steel Sword, Sickle, Sleep Staff
Armor Shop: Dancer Clothes, Evade Clothes, Fur Robe, Iron Apron,
Iron Shield, Tray Shield, Bunny Tiara

 Welcome to the hell on earth that the monsters made for those humans who
tried to change classes.  There's a lot of stuff sitting around in chests,
barrels, and pots, so be sure to explore around and pick up everything.  If
you want to, you can fight an EvilArmor on the southwest side of town.
There's no reward for it, though.  As you wander about, you'll eventually
run into a couple of monsters offering something called the SoulSword,
which will give the user back their abilities when they stab five people
with it.  Nobody gets the chance to use it, though, since a bully named
Suifu interferes, and decides to kick your ass.  Defeating him is (almost)
impossible.  Seriously.  Even if you were 10 levels higher, he'd still wipe
up the floor with you, since you can only heal via Herbs at this point.

 After you're defeated, you'll wake up in somebody's house.  Get used to
this, it's going to happen again around here.  Can you see why this is the
most hated part of the game?  Anyway, go upstairs and recruit Flower.  He
will give you the nearly-worthless WondeRock (which is essentially an ever-
lasting Herb; whoopdedoo), and tell you to head through the cave.  I do
suggest you stock up heartily on Herbs before you go.

Location: West Cave
Monsters: MudDoll, Smoocher, ZombieEye, Armorpion, PigDemon, Mantipion

 Go on through, and try to preserve your Herbs (since they are your only
source of healing now).  I'm sure you'll hate Mantipions before long, the
cheap critical-anytime bastards.  Upon reaching the two bosses of the cave,
Flower will trick you, and you'll be stuck fighting the monsters.  Like
Suifu, this is one of those stupid "you-shall-lose-no-matter-what" fights,
unless you leveled up way too much (not that you actually get anything for
beating these two at this point; it acts like you lost).  Don't you just
hate those kinds of fights?  So pointless...  Anyway, now you're (once
again) back at Neris' house.

 NOTE: If you haven't bought it yet, you can buy the Thief Key from this
town.  Get it now!

 Now, go outside, and find Zaji and Kasim in the bar.  Go back upstairs,
and madness begins to unfold.  Uh oh.  Go and follow the pink-armored guy,
and watch as trouble ensues.  Once the cutscenes are over, head back to the
western cave where you got whupped earlier, and through it.  Strangely, the
two monsters are not present now, but why complain about that?  Catch up
with Neris and Kasim, and then exit the area to the mountain village.

Location: Mountain Village	Suggested Level: 14-16
Gold: 35G
Items: TinyMedal x2, Herb, Horned Hat, Leather Armor, Antidote (1 WellLure)
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Star Ort

 One of the TinyMedals is in the graveyard, if you're wondering.  You can
also buy things from the woman in the far right house, as well as rest for
free.  You can find the other medal in the well, but beware: the well is
guarded by a WellLure monster.  Finally, go into the building on the upper
left side of the village to find a priest who will let you save.  When you
have taken in the details of your new base of operations, go and pay a
visit to that traitor, Flower.  Then, go find Kasim, and agree to help him
out.  Follow Flower and Kasim, and enter the prison cave.

Location: Prison Cave		Suggested Level: 14-16
Monsters: Smoocher, ZombieEye, Armorpion, PigDemon, Babbleoon, Pummeler,
Wyvern
Gold: 50G
Items: DEFseed, Sickle, TinyMedal x2, STRseed, Dung, MysticNut,
 Iron Shield, WorldLeaf

 This dungeon is annoyance incarnate.  I can't give an accurate walkthrough
of it, because quite frankly, I can't find any real fixed way to go about
finding your way through it.  Expect to backtrack a lot, and possibly even
get lost a bit.  Eventually, you'll find the high priestess Fosse, who is
trapped.  Go up the ladder, and, using the blocks present up there, smash
the orbs that have ensnared her.  Now you have to fight those stupid
monsters from before, Inopp and Goz.  Fortunately, they can only use their
basic attacks now, so the fight is winnable.  Take standard boss battle
precautions involving healing, focus on the pig first, and you should
prevail.  After the battle, you have to take the priestess all the way back
through the prison to the mountain village.  What a pain...

Location: Mountain Village	Suggested Level: 15-16
New Items: Dharma Key

 Once you're back, save up, then go find Kasim.  Hmm, something's funny
about Neris.  Go talk to the high priestess to get the Dharma Key, and then
go back to the prison cave.  This time, though, head towards the door to
the right.  Neris will ask for the key, but tell her no.  Now you have to
fight the monster that was doubling as her, a Maneater.  The fight isn't
too hard, but be sure to keep your HP up, as this enemy does hit hard.
After a short cutscene, Zaji will be back to normal, and you can proceed
into the bowels of the Dharma Temple.

Location: Below Dharma		Suggested Level: 15-17
Monsters: Pummeler, Mantipion, BeakRat, PigDemon, Babbleoon
Gold: 15G, 100G, 350G, 200G
Items: Antidote, Herb, TinyMedal, DEFseed, Dung x2, STRseed, WorldLeaf,
 AGLseed, Kitten Shield (2 EvilPot)

 This pseudo-dungeon is relatively straightforward, but it hardly matters.
By now, you're probably getting sick of this overly long quest.  Well, make
your way inwards and upwards, and pretty soon, you'll reach the glowing orb
that holds your sealed abilities.  Step under it to regain them!  Finally!
Now, go on in to reclaim Dharma!  Make your way through what remains of
this pseudo-dungeon, and on up to... the arena?  Don't you just hate Enix
right about now?

Location: Dharma Arena		Suggested Level: 15-17
Gold: 50G, 7G
Items: Herb x2, Antidote, Scale Armor
Weapon Shop: Mallet, Sickle, Blade Boomerang, Iron Spear, Wizard Staff
Armor Shop: Evade Clothes, Iron Armor, Captain Hat, Tray Shield

 Gaaah!  So close, yet so damned far.  Save (might as well, what with all
that's happened), and go talk to Neris and Zaji.  Let Zaji join you, then
go and enter the tournament.  The first round is easy, since it's only a
few weak DrakSlimes and Nepro.  Beating them is not a big challenge, but be
wary of Nepro's confusion spell, PanicAll.  Match #2 is Garcia and three
BoltRats.  The fight is a pain, since BoltRats can use Flash (which blinds
your characters for one turn), but it's still quite possible to win.  The
third match is Thompson and three Goopis.  The fight is much easier (since
nobody here can confuse or blind you).  The fourth round is against Naputo
and three Smoochers.  Be sure to dispose of the Smoochers ASAP, since they
have the annoying ability to put every party member to sleep.  Naputo is a
cheap bastard (meaning he can attack twice per turn), but if you keep up at
healing, you can beat him.  Round five is against DonJose and three
BeakRats.  The BeakRats aren't the big threat here, so you can more or less
ignore them until DonJose is down.

 Now, the final battle commences, against none other than Neris!  She has
three SlimeNites backing her up, whom you should take out first (since they
can heal).  The fight will take a while, but as long as you're dilligent
about healing when necessary, you'll win.  After the fight, some story
scenes will commence.  You can fight pretty much every monster here, but
why bother?  Grab the 7G from the barrel back here, use the inn, save, and
then head upstairs to the Dharma Temple proper.

Location: Dharma Temple		Suggested Level: 16-18
New Items: MysticNut, TinyMedal, LandShard, LifeAcorn, Wizard Ring,
Leather Hat
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, BugPowder, SpiderWeb
Weapon Shop: Mallet, Sickle, Iron Spear, Blade Boomerang, Wizard Staff
Armor Shop: Bronze Armor, Chain Armor, Iron Apron, Iron Shield, Iron Helmet

 Go ahead and grab the items that are protected by the electrified tiles if
you want.  Or don't.  They'll still be there when you're done beating up
the boss, and none of them are really going to help for the fight.  Anyway,
go and take on that bastard, Antoria (or is it Antolia?)!  Payback time for
taking away your magic!  If you haven't figured it out yet, Antoria is the
guy posing as the High Priest, so go talk to him to begin the fight.

Boss: Antoria		Suggested Level: 16-18
HP: 1,200
Strategy: Antoria is a pain in the arse.  He can take two turns at once, he
does a lot of damage, and he almost always hits first.  Healing is critical
in this fight, and you might just have to use a few of those WorldLeafs
you've collected if you want to survive.  Fosse will provide some good
cover fire, so at least the boss is beatable.  If you get lucky, he might
end up wasting a few turns casting MagicWall over and over again.  If not,
as I said, have those WorldLeafs ready.  As with a surprisingly large
number of bosses, Gabo's Bark can stun Antoria for a turn, so feel free to
give that a go if his two-turn antics are driving you batty.

 Dharma is reclaimed!  Congratulations on getting past this, the most
annoying sequence in the game.  Now you can change your party's classes to
whatever you want.  You can get a few helpful pointers from my guide above,
if you want, or you can experiment as you see fit.  There's a little bit of
plot left for this chapter of the game, but I'm sure you can handle that.
It's entirely optional anyway.

NOTICE: When leveling up jobs, there are three things to consider: enemy
experience, level limit, and the level cap.  Enemies that give a lot of
experience will actually hinder you now, so you may want to run from them
(or dispose of them with Expel/KnockDown/Disperse).  Level caps prevent you
from leveling 'til the cows come home in any given area, so pay attention
to what the level limits are for each area.  And finally, disc 1 has a
level limit cap of 36 on it, so even if an area lets you level up beyond
that normally, until you reach disc 2, you won't be able to level up jobs
there past level 36.

 On a side note, you should also return to Penal to steal from the treasure
chests in the World Bank there.  Free items are always a good thing!
Besides, there's a Shard in one of the chests.

NOTE: From this point on, your class abilities are more important than your
level.  As such, the level span listed is much, much larger.

NOTE 2: Now that you have the ThiefKey, there are numerous locked chests
that you can unlock.  You might want to go and unlock them now.

 After you're satisfied with your classes (which should be quite a while
from now, if you're smart and choose to level up a few of them), head back
to the present.  If you talk to Maribel and Gabo, they'll encourage you to
go see King Burns, but you really don't have to if you don't want to.
Dharma has returned in the present, as well (of course), and you can change
your class in the present version if you so wish.  For now, head south, to
where Penal used to be.  There's a guy laying down there, who will call
several allies once you talk to or walk past him.  Fight and deafeat them
(you'll probably need to have gained a few stars in at least one class to
do this).  They'll run off to the cave, so run and catch up with them and
watch as they basically tell you what the password is.  Idiots...  Go ahead
and enter the cave.

Location: Bandit Cave		Suggested Level: 18-24
Items: Cloth Shirt, Dung, Bandit Key, LandShard, TinyMedal, Iron Shield*,
Iron Spear*

 There's not much you can grab at first, but once you nab the Bandit Key
from the dresser, you can access the three treasure chests in the locked
grate area.  Go fight BanditWig for the LandShard, but beware: he's a very
powerful little guy!  The only good thing is that he has very little MP.
Beating him up should not prove difficult, if you leveled up your classes
enough.  LandShard in hand, it's time to visit the Dharma of the present,
as well as the Last Inn (if you haven't already, that is).

 Once you've collected everything, go and locate Mezar.  It's west of the
Dharma temple, across the sea, on a tiny island.

Location: Mezar
Gold: 6G, 7G
Items: LandShard, Pirate Shirt, Traveler Clothes, Repellent, LifeRock,
TinyMedal, Herb, Healer Heart, Carpet
Equipment Shop: Chain Whip, Dagger, Iron Armor, Shell Clothes,
White Shield, Shell Shield, IronMask

 Go into the bar, and see a little scene involving a poet named Nicola.
What an oddball.  Go up to his house and talk to him, and tell him that you
are adventurers.  Follow him underground into his storeroom (snatching all
of the stuff in it), then talk to him.  Take his carpet outside of town,
try to use it, then return and talk to him again (tell him the truth).  Go
follow him to the treasury, then go back to his house and talk to the maid.
Well, you're at a standstill at this point, so just collect the rest of the
items in town, then leave.  Now, go back to the Ancient Fane (you'll have
to leave Mezar to do so, there's a magic seal there for some reason that
makes Return not work), and onward to Dune.


Dune and the Evil Statue				[D1DUNE]
-----------------------==

PEDESTAL: Dune (Land room, center)
PIECES: Dialac (in a barrel in Joseph's secret base #1), Mentare (present;
in a treasure chest in the boss' house), Lake Cave (past; in a chest in the
passage opened by the TerraBell), Dharma (present; in the storeroom chest),
Western Cave (BanditWig gives it to you for defeating him)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 27

Location: Dune Area		Suggested Level: 18-24
Monsters: Babbleoon, BeakRat, HornRush, Wyvern, VenomBird

 This is one big desert.  Go and visit the palace, since the village won't
let you in.

Location: Dune Palace
Items: SilkRobe

 The palace is decidedly dead.  Make your way to the basement, and into the
makeshift graveyard room (it's not difficult to locate; the castle is a
castle, not a dungeon).  A guy called Hadeed will show up and chew you out,
then tell you to go to the village nearby.  Might as well, there's nothing
to do here right now, anyway.  Head southeast to the village.

Location: Dune Village
Gold: 7G
Items: DEFseed, TinyMedal, Antidote, DuneCharm, Herb
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, Repellent, LifeRock, Star Ort

 Since you've met Hadeed, they'll let you come in.  Raid the village of the
items in it, then go see the village chief (in the big house in the rear of
the town).  Talk to him, then talk to the woman guarding the ladder.  Use
the bed upstairs to get the plot moving again, then head back downstairs.
Talk to the village chief will tell you of what's been going on, and tell
you to avoid the palace.  Yeah, right.  Head back there now.  There are
monsters in the palace now, so take care.  The graveyard now has a monster
waiting for you to fight, BoneRider.  Hadeed will help out, but don't rely
on him to finish the fight.  BoneRider isn't a big threat.  He does have
the ability to take two turns at once, but he's barely got any HP.

 Once the fight is over, the monster will drop a pendant (which Hadeed
takes), and Hadeed will order you to follow him.  Go ahead and do so.  A
sandstorm has started, so you're trapped for the time being.  Talk to
Hadeed again.  After the story scenes are over, go talk to Hadeed again.
Exit the palace, and talk to Hadeed outside of Dune.  Now, go to the
elder's house, and talk to Hadeed (he's in the doorway).  Go inside, and
watch the story scene, then talk to Hadeed and the elder.  After yet
another short story scene, talk to the elder and Hadeed once more.  Talk to
Hadeed to hear what the Queen's letter says.  Talk to the elder to get the
DuneCharm.  You can get more info from the villagers by showing it to them.
Show it to the man guarding the hut on the east side of town to get in
there.  You can find the women hiding down there, as well as the Herb
mentioned in the items list above.  You can also get hints on how to
ressurect Tyrannos from people around town by showing them the DuneCharm.
Show it to everybody.  Once you have, go northwest to the banks of the
Nila, and talk to Hadeed.  It seems pretty hopeless, but there is a way to
solve the problem.  Head back to the present.

 Head for the excavation site, tell the researcher about Dune, and show him
the DuneCharm.  He'll give you the Fossil, and demand that you take him
back in time to Dune.  You'll have no choice in the matter, so just leave
the excavation site.  Take the scholar to the palace.  Now, head straight
for Dune, and show the bone to the elder.  Too bad he's comatose.  Head
for the exit, then go follow Hadeed to see his father again.  After a long
story scene, you should leave the room.  Head back towards the exit (where
Hadeed passes you and delivers some bad news), and talk to Hadeed.  After
some story scenes, you'll be back at the Nila.  Talk to Hadeed, and watch
the short funeral.  Talk to Hadeed, then walk up to the river bank and use
the TyranBone.  An FMV will commence (one of the better ones), and Tyrannos
is reborn!  Save your game, then talk to Hadeed to head for the Evil
Statue.  On the far bank, depart for the statue proper.

Location: Evil Statue
Monsters: WarTiger, FoggyPot, NailMan, TrickBag
Gold: 350G
Items: STRseed, DEFseed, Black Key, Speed Ring, TinyMedal, Silver Apron,
(2 EvilPot, 2 Cannibox)

 NOTE: Grab everything in this dungeon before completing it!

 Go catch up with Hadeed, and talk to him.  He'll run off as usual, leaving
you to deal with two stronger-than-normal Pigmons.  But worry not, you'll
be healed right after the fight.  Head into the Sphinx ASAP.  Use the
DuneCharm on the plaque.  Now, for a mini-puzzle: placing the statues on
the proper pedestals.  Put them as follows: lion on first pedestal, turtle
on second, eagle on third, and snake on fourth.  Head upstairs, where some
Pigmons are gloating.  Hmph.  Head upstairs again (through the non-spiked
pathway), then back downstairs via the second stairway.  Go around the
previously spike-laden walk, and up the set of stairs there.  The queen is
up here, talking to Hadeed.  Talk to the queen to get the Black Key.  Now,
walk on upstairs (ignore the chest unless you're a die-hard completionist;
it's a Cannibox) across the damage tiles.  The area around the tiles is
laden with pits, so it's the easiest way.  The treasure room is on the
next floor, so be sure to loot it, then head up to the next level.

 The women are resisting.  That's good.  Be sure to grab the Silver Apron
before going up to save them.  After that, head outside via the door, and
into the Sphinx from the side door.  Kill the Pigmon, then head up into the
"maze".  There's only one path, so it's more like just a really twisted
tunnel to the top.  Head outside, and prepare to battle Set (mistranslated
as both Seto and Seth), the Egyptian god of the underworld!

BOSS: Set		Suggested Level: 19-24
HP: 800
Strategy: Heal as necessary, and attack when you get the chance.  This boss
will actually kill himself eventually with his Massacre attacks, but if you
want, you can hurry it up by using your own skills.  He's really only
difficult if he starts killing your allies.  Gosh, isn't that a helpful
bit of advice?  Heal AI setting may be helpful on your ally with the most
healing spells learned...

 Now, the queen will make an appearance.  Agree to help, then head for the
left side of the statue and grab the ruby.  This will destroy the Evil
Statue for good.  Once you get the chance, talk to Hadeed's body.  Now,
you'll be back in Dune.  Talk to Hadeed, then head into the storehouse and
raid it of the treasures remaining in it (a LandShard and a Leather Whip;
some treasure).  Head for the palace, and talk to the scholar.  He'll give
you a Package for the guy guarding the dig site.  Go back to the present
and visit that excavation site again.

Location: Excavation Site
New Items: LandShard, TinyMedal

 As you can see, the rip-off merchant has a new partner.  Refuse to pay the
10G (though that is as much pocket change as 5G is, you don't have to pay),
and go talk to the guard down in the pit.  Get the LandShard from the
chest, and the TinyMedal from the vase.  Go back to Dune now (yes, the past
version), and visit the palace.

Location: Dune Palace
New Gold: 210G
New Items: Golden Ring, TinyMedal, FireShard

 Restoration is underway, as you can see.  Go talk to the queen.  She'll
give you a Dark Ruby, and access to her treasure room.  Go and raid it,
then head out to the Sphinx.  Hadeed will pilot the raft there for you.  At
the Sphinx, talk to Hadeed again.  Go follow him.  The scholar obviously
has something he wants.  Talk to them both, and the scholar will give the
necklace back to Hadeed.  Talk to Hadeed, then watch the story scene.  It
looks like everything is back to normal again.  Now, it's time to visit
Dune Castle in the present.  Before you do, though, check out the little
chunk of land near the village (in the present, of course).  There's a
portal back to the Fane there.  That could prove useful.  Okay, now visit
the castle in the present.

Location: Dune Palace
Items: Silver Tiara, Noble Clothes, Silk Garter

 In a surprise turn of events, somebody at the castle recognizes you as the
legendary heroes of Dune.  Looks like historical records carry on in this
country a bit better than they do in other nations.  The benefits of this
are mainly that people will treat you like deities.  Well, it beats getting
treated like peasants.  Snatch the stuff in the castle.  There's nothing
else to do here, so head for the village.

Location: Dune
Gold: 15G
Items: Herb, Dancer Clothes, TinyMedal, LifeAcorn, Dung, LandShard,
AmitSnack, MysticNut
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent, LifeRock, BunnyTail

 Isn't it nice to be recognized for your efforts for once?  Since you have
already visited the castle, everybody in town recognizes you!  If only all
of the areas were like this...  Grab the stuff in town, then leave.  It's
not as though you can do much here right now, anyway.  Head up the river to
the little house on the northwest tip of the Dune continent.

Location: Rose's House
Items: Graceherb, SilkRobe

 There's nothing to do here but grab the items at this point.  After that,
head back to the Ancient Fane.


Krage and the World Tree				[D1KRAGE]
-----------------------==

PEDESTAL: Krage (Land room, lower left)
PIECES: Dharma (past; in one of the basement chests), Dune (past; in one of
the chests in the storeroom), Dune (present; in the gigantic pot in the
center of town)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 30

Location: Krage	Island		Suggested Level: 20-25
Monsters: ApeBat, FloatTree, HangedApe, WarTiger

 There's not a lot here to see on this tiny island, so head for the nearby
inn.  Not much to see here, though the people here state that something is
strange in the nearby village.  Might want to go check that out next.

Location: Krage
Gold: 3G
Items: Cloth Shirt, TinyMedal, Leather Hat

 Something is decidedly wrong with this place.  Everybody thinks that
they're the Demon Lord.  Go find the elder's house, and talk to him.  Leave
his home, but he'll stop you and ask you to warn some lady near the Sacred
Tree of what's happened here.  Agree to help him out, then leave his home.
Some cloaked man is egging the deluded villagers on outside of the elder's
house, but you can just ignore them for now.  Go to the Sacred Tree.

 The woman you're supposed to talk is in the hut here.  Visit her, but as
you'll see, you can't seem to wake her up, so exit the house.  Head back to
Krage, then hurry back to the Sacred Tree.  Talk to the villagers if you'd
like, but there's no getting through to them.  Say you're going to stop
them.  The cloaked guy will fight you now.  He's easy, though, so don't
worry.  After the fight, the villagers and masked man all retreat.  Talk to
the unconcious girl and take her into her hut to get things moving again.

 When you get the chance, talk to the girl.  Grab the jug, and collect some
HolyDew.  Use the HolyDew on the girl, and she'll ask you to save the
villagers with it.  Go back to the village and give the elder a sip of it.
He'll suggest that you use the HolyDew in the well.  Go ahead and try that.
Since that didn't work, go talk to the elder once more.  He'll suggest that
you try the underground water vein.  That links to the Sacred Tree...  Go
back there, and talk to the girl there.  She'll give you access to the
Sacred Tree Root.

Location: Sacred Tree Root
Monsters: Metaly, FloatTree, Horseman, HangedApe, WarTiger, ApeBat

 Words like "big" and "huge" only begin to describe this place.  I think
"stupid" and "inane" would be useful additions.  This dungeon (as it were)
is relatively easy to traverse, but it can be confusing at times.  Just
remember that there's really only one path for most of the dungeon that you
can follow.  When you reach the area where it seems like a dead end, try
jumping off where the bark has been skinned off of the root.  Once you
reach the cave section, you're almost out of there.  Just head up the vine
ladders, watch the scene with the monsters, head up another vine ladder,
and drop in on their little party.  You'll have to fight an EvilWell (not a
tough fight), and then use the HolyDew on the well.  Krage is saved!

 Head up through the rope ladder, and fight the WolfDevil.  He's a strong
bugger, but I'm sure you can handle him by now.  He has around 800 HP, but
I would hardly call him a boss.  Anyway, after his defeat, Krage is truly
saved.  Go talk to the elder, then to the farmer to get a FireShard, and
finally to the girl at the Sacred Tree for a Bless Staff.  Now, head back
to the future (er, present) and visit Krage there.

Location: Krage/World Tree
Gold: 13G, 5G
Items: Traveler Clothes, TinyMedal x2, Fur Hat, AmitDonut, FireShard x2,
INTseed*, INTSpecs*, Silk Hat
Item Shop: WorldDew
Equipment Shop: Dagger, Steel Sword, Steel Claw, Blade Boomerang,
Glam Clothes, Shell Clothes, Silk Hat

 As you can see, Krage has grown, and there are obscenely large numbers of
wells here.  Raid the town, including Brugeo's vacation manor (which you
can enter from the back door).  Talk to the maid downstairs to get her to
move (so you can nab the stuff in the storeroom), then talk to her again
after you've broken all the bottles in there to get paid 50G.  Hmph, some
pay.  Anyway, go visit the World Tree next, and grab the FireShard there.
If you have no WorldLeafs, you can always come back here and talk to the
blue bird for another one.  There's nothing left to do in the present, so
head for Litorud.


Distortions of Time					[D1LITORUD]
------------------==

PEDESTAL: Litorud (Fire room, center)
PIECES: Krage (past; given to you by a farmer after saving Krage), Krage
(present; in the basement of Brugeo's vacation home), Sacred Tree (present;
on the ground outside)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 33

Location: Litorud Area		Suggested Level: 21-27
Monsters: WarTiger, Needlon, BoltRat, Metaly, Horseman

 This area is small enough, and it's fairly obvious where the village is.
Head there now.

Location: Litorud
Gold: 10G, 15G
Items: Herb x3, TinyMedal, Silk Hat, MysticNut, Traveler Clothes, Turban,
Repellent, LifeRock, Horned Hat (1 EvilBook)
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent
Weapon Shop: Hammer, Holy Spear, Iron Axe, Steel Sword, Steel Claw, Chain
Whip
Armor Shop: Iron Armor, Shell Clothes, Steel Armor, Magic Robe, Magic
Shield, White Shield, IronMask

 The town seems nice enough.  At least there's no signs of trouble.  Grab
everything here, and talk to the folks in town.  Apparently, a bridge is
opening up tomorrow!  Might as well visit it today, though, and grab the
stuff there.

Location: Baloch Bridge
Gold: 6G
Items: Leather Hat, SeaShell Hat (1 EvilWell)
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, BugPowder, SpiderWeb

 The bridge has items, and... um... yeah, items.  There's nothing much else
to say about it.  Talk to the people here just for the hell of it (be sure
you talk to the bridge guard in particular).  Now, why not take a nice
little detour to the strange and (not quite) wonderful layer of that insane
designer, Baloch?  His tower is to the east.

Location: Baloch Tower
Items: INTseed, Clock Key

 Baloch is a bit antisocial, isn't he?  Might as well go back to town and
stay at the inn.  At last, the day of the bridge opening has arrived!  Or
has it?  Talk around town, and you'll see that everybody seems to think
it's still yesterday.  Uh oh...  Go see the bridge guard again, then go
stay at the inn again.  It should be obvious at this point that time is
repeating endlessly.  Go see the bridge guard yet again, then go pay Baloch
a visit.  He'll give you the Clock Key, and tell you to turn off the clock
tower in town.  Do that (you may want to save first), and check out what
happens.  Time has frozen!  Go check out the painting in Creyney's
basement.  It's glowing...  Hop in to enter the temporal vortex.

Location: Temporal Vortex
Monsters: HangedApe, SmileRock, Needlon, Metaly, NailMan, BoltRat, WarTiger
Gold: 350G
Items: Speed Ring, AGLseed, TinyMedal, Potion (1 EvilPot, 2 Cannibox)

 NOTE: Grab everything in this dungeon before completing it!

 The vortex is pretty straightforward, at first.  It's essentially just
your typical 3D rendering of a rather famous Salvador Dali painting.  Grab
the stuff lying around, and make your way to the end of the first part.
Take one of the two teleporters in the first area (not the one near the
drop-off point with the AGLseed chest) to get to another area with the
TinyMedal in it.  Once you have that, take the lower area teleporter to the
pseudo-puzzle teleporter area.  Take as many teleporters as you can, to get
the 350G (and reach the healing spot).  Once you reach the last teleporter,
you'll be taken to a last little puzzle.  The answer is simple: head up to
the XII, and head left and around backwards across IX, VI, and III, back to
XII.  This will reveal a teleporter that will take you to the room that the
TimeSage is in.  Boss fight time!

BOSS: TimeSage		Suggested Level: 22-27
HP: 1,000		Item: LandShard
Strategy: Get rid of the Makimaki enemies first, as they can use Time Sand
(which restarts the battle; very annoying).  Use your heaviest-hitting
attacks on TimeSage, and he'll go down in no time.  Don't forget to heal
when necessary (of course; it's basic RPG strategy to heal when necessary).
I don't recall TimeSage having any really devestating or unexpected attacks
in his arsenal, and his allies are more annoying than he is, so this
battle should (hopefully) just be an exercise in tedium.

 Smash the hourglass, since this will (as TimeSage helpfully tells you)
restore time to proper working order.  This will net you some invaluable
Time Sand, which resets battles when used, and teleport you back to the
basement of Creyney's house.  Everything is back to normal, it seems, so go
stay at the inn.  Finally, the bridge is opened!  Go see the ceremony, then
cross it at last.  Now, after all that, you'd expect this adventure to be
over, right?  Wrong!  Don't worry about combat; that part is over.  Now
it's just a story sequence left in this area.  Go cross the bridge, and
check out what's on the other side.  Hmm, another village.  Something about
the terrain might seem... familiar.

Location: Verdham
Gold: 50G, 3G, 500G*
Items: TinyMedal x2, Cloth Shirt, DEFseed, SilkRobe, Tights
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent
Equipment Shop: Holy Spear, Power Claw, Destruct Sword, Chain Whip,
Wizard Robe, Silver Apron, IronMask

 Yep, it's Verdham.  You might remember this town from about five areas
before.  It's thirty years later, though, and there's a mystery in town
that needs solving (and, of course, items that need collecting).  Wander
about town and talk to folks to get the scoop on what's been happening in
the last thirty years.  It seems that Iwan married Linda, who then left him
to search for Pepe.  Starting to sound like a soap opera, isn't it?  Iwan
also lost the mansion, and that little skank Kaya now runs the place.

 To get things moving, try to enter the mansion.  Eppe (Iwan and Linda's
son) will be chewing his father out.  Visit the kitchen of the mansion to
see a scene involving some food.  This might seem inane, but it'll prove
important later.  Go talk to Cherri in the garden, then track Iwan down
(he's at his little house on the west side of town).  It seems that Kaya
still has a thing for Iwan.  Go visit Kopan and Cherri again.  Uh oh!  Go
help out with Kopan.  It seems that the dog got ahold of some poison.  Hmm,
wonder where that might've come from?  Talk to Porta or Cherri, and Cherri
will catch on.  It seems that the master of the manor is sick for a reason.
Go follow her to the manor, and listen in on her fight with lady Kaya.  So,
the mistress denies it.  Typical.  Go follow Cherri, and talk to her.  A
bit of proof is what you need.  Go downstairs, outside, and try to re-enter
the mansion. Watch as lady Kaya leaves yet again, this time dropping her
bottle of poison.  How convenient!  Go show it to Cherri.

 Lend her the bottle, and follow her downstairs.  The master of the house
is hungry, and Cherri's going to expose Kaya for what she really is now.
Go to the bottom floor, and visit the kitchen.  Kaya's panicking, which is
hardly surprising.  Leave the manor and visit Porta.  Talk to him or Cherri
to find out that the purple bottle does in fact contain poison.  Go back
through the front door, and talk to the lord of the house.  Agree to eat
with him.  Watch the cutscene, and enjoy as Kaya is exposed as the bitch we
all know she is.  Kaya and Iwan get kicked out of town (serves them right,
the little hoochies).  Go visit Cherri in the garden for a bit of closure
to this story, and also pay Eppe a visit.  Check the letter to find out
what Iwan's last words to his son were.  Go pay the Mentare of this age a
visit, as well.  (NOTE: If you're wondering, the swamp cave is still north
of town, but the place is just as cleaned out as you left it in the visit
you made 30 years ago.)

Location: Mentare
Gold: 2G
Items: AGLseed, Silver Tiara, TinyMedal, STRseed, DEFseed
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, AGL Scarf

 Pepe's already made Mentare this impressive.  Nothing much to do here just
yet, but grab the stuff around town, then head up the Geionne Path.

Location: Geionne Path/Monestary
Gold: 15G, 5G
Items: TinyMedal, STR Ring*, SilkRobe

 Get the stuff, move on up the path.  You can also talk to the priestess in
the cave about halfway up the path for some info on sister Bessia (though
she calls her Beshia).  The monestary is more or less the same as ever.
Grab the stuff here, and be sure to check the grave out on the edge of the
cliff.  Now, go tell Pepe down in Mentare about it, and bring him up here
to see the grave.  After Pepe's done lamenting, it's okay for you to head
back to the present.  Or if you want, you can finish up Baloch's story by
visiting Dr. Keel, then Baloch, then Dr. Keel again.  Your call, it's just
an optional sequence.  Anyway, go visit the modern Litorud now.

Location: Litorud
Gold: 5G
Items: Scarf, Graceherb x2, Glam Clothes, Horned Hat, WindShard, Herb x2,
Repellent, Emily's Letter, INTseed, WarpWing
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent
Weapon Shop: Hammer, Iron Axe, Steel Sword, Destruct Sword, Steel Claw,
Power Claw, Chain Whip
Armor Shop: Evade Clothes, Wizard Robe, Silver Apron, Platinum Shield,
Magic Shield, IronMask, Captain Hat

 This place has a new feature: rankings!  Go check out the Style Ranking,
then talk to the people in the ranking office.  It seems that the old woman
named Rose (living north of Dune) is still #1 on the style ranking list.
Go talk to her, and she'll give you a letter that asks that she be removed
from the list.  Give it to the man at the front desk of the ranking office,
and now you have a (remote) chance of winning the style contest.  If you
want to try, equip Maribel with the full Bunny outfit (Bunny Ears, Bunny
Suit, Tray Shield, Tights) and enter her; that will give her a 136 APR
score minimum.  Besides that, there's not much to see or do in Litorud.  If
you find Emily's Letter and give it to the scholar upstairs, he'll give you
the INTseed mentioned above.  Anyway, grab the stuff around town, upgrade
equipment if necessary, then pay the bridge a visit (if you haven't
already), and the tower.

Location: Baloch Bridge
Items: TinyMedal x2, INTSpecs, Graceherb
Shop: Dagger, Blade Boomerang, Boxer Shorts, Bunny Suit, Dancer Clothes,
SilkRobe, Tray Shield, Bunny Tiara, Silver Tiara

 The bridge is the same as ever, but you can't buy from the shop unless you
have a ranking in the top 30 style rankings at Litorud.  Amazingly, there
are TWO TinyMedals here.  Be sure to grab both.

Location: Baloch Tower
Monsters: Eggeron, Metaly, EvlMantis
Items: Bow Tie, DEFseed, SilkTux, TinyMedal, INTseed, WindShard, LandShard

 The tower is sort of a puzzle-box.  Amazingly, nobody has ever solved it
before you got here.  I say amazingly because, quite frankly, the puzzles
are all simple and easy to solve.  The people around here must be
exceptionally stupid...  Anyway, the first floor puzzle is very obvious:
push both statues onto the thin carpet strips, so that the door to the next
floor opens.  The second floor has a few points where the columns will
attack you, so be ready for that.  Go down the moving floor, across the
one safe tile to walk across, and all the way around (ignore the first
outside door; it's a dead end).  Two ColumnMan fights later, you'll be out
on the balcony.  Go on inside the other doorway, and fall down the pit onto
the elevator.  Activate it (of course) to get to the third floor.

 The puzzle here is simple: use the ruby to open a path to the exit.  You
will also need to grab the rock in the area near the SilkTux chest, and
push it to the triggerable carpet area.  The rest of the floor is so
obvious that, if you need a walkthrough, you should probably have your head
examined.  The fourth floor is really easy; it's just rotating around.  To
get to the other end is a simple task indeed.  On the roof, hit the switch
to empty the pond and gain access to the treasure room.  The puzzle down
here is also simple.  You need to find the three switches to get rid of the
blocking statues.  One is down the path in the waterway, another is across
some damage tiles on the upper right, and the last one is cleverly hidden
behind the monolith on the upper left.  The switch to reach the treasure
room is under the middle statue.

 The treasure room has quite a bit of stuff in it, including the important
WindShard and LandShard items.  That's what we came here for, actually.
Head back to the Ancient Fane, and unseal the Hamelia area.


The Minstrel and the Flood				[D1HAMELIA]
-------------------------==

PEDESTAL: Hamelia (Land room, lower right)
PIECES: Penal (past; in one of the bank's chests), Mezar (on the island in
the well), Dig Site (in a chest in the site itself), Temporal Vortex
(gained from defeating the TimeSage), Baloch Tower (in the treasure room on
the top floor)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 36

Location: Hamelia Continent	Suggested Level: 23-28
Monsters: NailMan, Needlon, BoltRat, Horseman, SmileRock, WellLure,
MuddyMan, HangedApe

 As usual, head for the nearby village.

Location: Avon
Gold: 20G
Items: Herb, TinyMedal
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent

 This place is tiny.  The people in town are talking about a minstrel who
came by recently, and played some very charming music for them.  Well, how
nice of him.  Grab what's lying about, then go see the village elder.  He
will lend you a bed to sleep in for the night.  Strange music will play
during the night, and the next morning, everybody is gone!  Strange
mystery, that one.  Time to take the Avon tunnel out to the other side of
the continent.

Location: Avon Tunnel
Monsters: MuddyMan, Enchanter, RockGolem, Dumbira
Items: MoonHerb, TinyMedal

 There's a few items here, but you can't access any but the MoonHerb and
TinyMedal until much later.  It's mostly a straightforward path to the
other end.  Once outside, go visit Huzu, at the southern point of the
continent.

Location: Huzu
Items: LifeAcorn, Leather Hat, Antidote, TinyMedal
Weapon Shop: Mace, Shears, Battle Axe, Power Fist, Mist Staff
Armor Shop: Wizard Robe, Viking Armor, Silk Garter, Magic Shield,
Platinum Shield, Captain Hat, Viking Helmet

 The minstrel's been here, too.  Grab everything around here, then stay at
the inn.  Again, the music will play at night, and everybody in town will
just vanish.  This is getting kind of creepy.  Head for Hamelia.

Location: Hamelia
Gold: 30G
Items: Iron Spear*, STRseed
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent, PinkPearl
Weapon Shop: Destruct Sword, Mace, Shears, Battle Axe, Flame Fist,
Dragon Tail
Armor Shop: Viking Armor, Skirt, Platinum Shield, Captain Hat,
Viking Helmet

 At last, you've caught up with the minstrel!  Gather the stuff in town,
save, and then stay at the inn.  During the night, you'll be woken up, and
see people walking into a glowing portal.  Step inside it to get to North
Tower.

Location: North Tower
Monsters: Enchanter, SlimeLv8, Eggeron, RockGolem, Dumbira, IronTurtl
Gold: 5G
Items: MysticNut, SpiderWeb, Dung, WindShard
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, PinkPearl, Pixy Sword

 NOTE: Grab everything in this dungeon before completing it!  Also, this is
your last chance to return to the present for a while, so if you need to
change jobs or anything like that, go do it now!

 This place is dangerously large, so be on your guard.  On the second
floor, there's a pit that you can fall into that will lead you to a lower
area where a slime runs from you and tells you that the people are all up
on the third floor.  Make your way to the top of the tower, and talk to the
minstrel up there.  After you do talk to him, the flood will commence!  A
bit of dialogue later, attempt to leave.  The bard will all but reveal his
identity (Jann, the Tula player for the Dejan era), and ask you to take on
the monsters.  He gives you a WindShard, and you'll be told to go on your
way.  Go down to the second floor, and board the raft.  Head for Huzu and
Hamelia if you want, or go straight to the palace under the sea.

Location: Sunken City
Monsters: MultiEyes, DeathCrab, EvilDiver, EvlTurtle, Confupeng, PutreFish,
EvlAnchor, Seahorser
Items: TinyMedal x3, AGLseed, Hork Heart, MoonHerb, Bounce Sword,
WorldLeaf, LifeAcorn, (1 JewelBag, 2 MadPot, 1 Mimic)

 NOTE: Grab everything in this dungeon before completing it!

 As you approach the sunken city, the hero's birthmark will start to burn,
and a path to the city will open.  Curious.  The first area of the city is
easy enough to manage; just make your way to the fane in the rear.  Be sure
to check the monuments in the first area; one leads to a hidden passage
(since you can't get to the fane without doing this).  Inside the fane,
drain the water from the pond, and head downstairs.  The puzzle here is
simple: drain the water.  To hit the switches, use the flying vases.  You
may want to get the Bounce Sword from upstairs (just extend the bridges to
the stairwell up).  Anyway, the third level is more of the same.  The
next floor is where Gracos is, so be sure to heal up.  Gracos will make you
fight some sub-monsters before you can face him, but they're nothing hard.
Gracos, on the other hand, is.

BOSS: Gracos		Suggested Level: 23-29
HP: 1,500
Strategy: Gracos loves to use breath attacks, so MagicWall or WoolGuard is
in order.  Other than that, keep your HP up and use your most damaging
attacks on him.  If he keeps whupping you, then you probably need better
battle skills.  Unfortunately, since you can't access Dharma right now,
that could be just a wee bit of a problem...

 After the fight, Gracos tries to trap you so you will die with him.  Talk
to the minstrel to get out of there.  This will take you back to North
Tower, and the flood will recede.  Now, go downstairs and through the
portal back to Hamelia.  If you check your inventory after this, you'll see
that the bard threw a Wizard Ring at you.  How nice of him.  It's time to
collect some rewards from here and Avon.

Location: Hamelia
Items: WindShard, Merm Moon

 Just go under the houses, and talk to the guard whose near the electrified
floor tiles.  Both treasures are critical, and I'm sure you know why the
Merm Moon is (remember Nicola from Mezar?).

Location: Avon Tunnel
Items: Berserkr Heart, Pirate Clothes

 Grab the items, then head back for the portal.  Now is as good a time as
any to visit the present version of the Hamelia continent.  Avon and Huzu
no longer exist, but Hamelia is certainly still there.  (NOTE: If you want,
you can also go visit Mezar now and get the Carpet.  If you want to get
your next party member ASAP, get the Carpet now, then read down below at
Mezar Fane.)

Location: Hamelia
Items: INTseed, TinyMedal
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, WarpWing, PinkPearl
Weapon Shop: Mace, Shears, Battle Axe, Flame Fist, Dragon Whip, Hacksaw,
Lune Fan
Armor Shop: Pirate Clothes, Viking Armor, Silver Armor, Skirt,
Platinum Shield, Captain Hat, Viking Helm

 A note on the TinyMedal: it's a bit hidden.  Go under the house with the
cat underneath it, and check the platform that the cat is standing on.
Unlike the last few areas, there's actually a quest (two, in fact) to
complete in the Hamelia area.  Go up to the watchtower and talk to the
professor and his assistant.  That shard could be useful, ask him for it.
He'll say he'll make a deal, and then wander off.  Go follow him to his
house, where he'll tell you that he wants to go to North Tower, but it's
too dangerous right now.  Might want to check that out.

Location: North Tower
Monsters: Same as in past
Gold: 50G
Items: BluePrint, FireShard, Dung, TinyMedal, Slime Heart, (2 MadPot)

 The tower is almost unchanged, as you can see.  Head down the stairs, and
fight the KingSlime down there.  He's tougher than normal, so beware.  He
drops the BluePrint.  Anyway, after the battle, allow Slachi to follow you
up to the tower.  You have to, so don't think you can skip this part.  Be
sure to get the FireShard from the far side of the tower's first floor.
The first three floors are the same as they were in the past.  Check the
grate to have Slachi open it.  There is a pitfall on the fourth floor now,
so be careful.  The top floor is home to <font color=blue>GigaMute</font>, the boss of the tower.

BOSS: <font color=blue>GigaMute</font>		Suggested Level: 23-29
HP: 1,000	Item: FireShard
Strategy: Really, he's not that difficult, as long as you're smart and heal
when necessary, as well as dish out decent damage.  If you're having
trouble, then you probably need to learn some more class abilities.

 After the fight, go pay the Slimes one last visit, then go see Azmov back
in Hamelia.  Go follow them back to north tower, and on up to the third
floor.  Talk to Azmov, and he'll tell you to go get the Shard yourself from
his storeroom in Hamelia.  Go do that.  You'll find a LifeAcorn and a
FireShard.

 With that little side story out of the way, return to Mezar and show the
Merm Moon to the maid.  Follow her to the rear of the temple, and talk to
her again.  She's forgotten where the entryway was.  Perfect.  Check around
the middle of the rear of the temple, right where the shadows end, to find
it.  Follow the maid down, and open the chest to get the Carpet.  Nicola
will show up and approve of your taking the carpet.  Go visit the fane just
north of Mezar.

Location: Mezar Fane
Items: LifeAcorn, WindShard

Talk to the spirit to hear a bit about the hero of legend.  Hmm, the
HotStone matches his description nicely.  Why not pay a visit to Estard?
Talk around, and you'll find out that Hondara is doing rather well right
now.  Be sure to talk to him directly, to find out why.  He's sold the
HotStone to some rich guy, huh?  Probably Brugeo.  Visit Brugeo's vacation
homes in Krage and Litorud (one or both, your call), then go back to Orph
and use the carpet to cross the lake to Brugeo's mansion.

Location: Brugeo's Mansion
Gold: 120G
Items: Bow Tie, TinyMedal*, Magic Key*, LandShard, Shell Clothes
 (1 EvilWell)

 Gather the items in the mansion, then go talk to Brugeo a few times.  He's
hopeless, so leave.  He'll ask to join you (let him), then go to the
World's Tallest Tower.  You can find it southwest of the Medal King's
castle (which is east of Hamelia; you need the carpet to reach the tower,
but that's not a problem).

Location: World's Tallest Tower
Monsters: ColumnMan, SkyFrog, Sheepbird, Chargon, PutreMan, Bugbear
Gold: 370G
Items: AGL Scarf, TinyMedal, FireShard

 As you approach the tower, the HotStone will open the door for you.  Head
up the tower (it's a bit convoluted, but there are no puzzles), right on
up to the platform at the very top.  There, place the HotStone upon the
altar, and the legendary hero, Melvin, will be revived!  Grab the FireShard
that came with him, as well.  Talk to Melvin, and he'll join your party.
Woot!  With four allies, things will be much easier.  Go talk to Brugeo,
then head to the base of the tower.  The easiest way to do this is to fall
off the tower from the previous floor.  As you try to leave, Brugeo will
take off for home.  Good riddance.  You might want to go to Dharma now and
give Melvin a proper class, and then pay Nicola in Mezar a visit.  You may
be in for a surprise, though.  Oh yes, if you want, you can also visit the
sunken city in the present now.

Location: Sunken City
Items: TinyMedal x2, GuardRuby, AmitDonut, MysticNut, FireShard, (2 MadPot)

 The city hasn't changed much, but at least there are no random encounters.
The city is now populated by monsters.  If you go into the fane in the rear
of the city, you can go and challenge Gracos V.  He's about as difficult
as his ancestor, but he has more HP, so don't face him unless you're
certain that you're ready for him.  Beating him gets you a ? Shard.  He
won't give you his other treasure just yet, though.

 Anyway, you have now completed the subject of this "act" of the game
(ressurecting Melvin, that is).  There's one last place to visit before we
head on back to the Ancient Fane.  Go return to the Sphinx via the Carpet.

Location: Sphinx
Items: AquaShard

 Other than the Shard, there's not a whole hell of a lot here.  Grab it,
then go back to the Fane and take your pick of where you want to go next.


                  Act III - Quest for the Truth
                 ==---------------------------==

NOTE: The next three areas can be done in any order, so long as you have
the shards for them (which you should have, if you've been following this
guide).  They must all be done to proceed with the quests that come after
them, though.  Before you return to the present from the last area of the
three that you do, unequip Maribel.


The Cursed Town of Loomin				[D1LOOMIN]
------------------------==

PEDESTAL: Loomin (Fire room, upper right)
PIECES: Dune Palace (past; found in the queen's treasure room), Mountain
Tower (present; found in a chest on the first floor), Mountain Tower
(present; won from <font color=blue>GigaMute</font>)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 39

Location: Loomin Island		Suggested Level: 24-30
Monsters: Stalker, Broadaxer, Thunderat, RhinoKing

 No point slouching around.  Go check out the hillock to the west.

Location: Dead Hill
Items: LandShard

 A big dead plant and a Shard.  Great scenery, but there's nothing else to
do here.  Head for the nearby town of Loomin.

Location: Loomin
Items: Herb, Horned Hat, Iron Axe*, IronMask*, HairBand, Repellent,
DEFseed, TinyMedal, Tower Key
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, Pot Lid

 As you'll quickly discover (simply as you try to enter), monsters run this
town.  Once you're done looting all of the houses and such, visit the well
on the far side of town.  Talk to the nun there, then go talk to the big
moose demon in the bathtub of the manor.  You'll have to fight him, but
he's not really that difficult.  After he's down, you'll have access to the
real source of Loomin's trouble, DarkDraco's tower.  Check the nearby
dresser that the PinkOrc was guarding, then head for the tower.

Location: DarkDraco's Tower
Monsters: Armorgon, Curer, LizrdBird, Dragon, BabyDevil, Broadaxer,
Rhinoking, Babydrak
Gold: 120G
Items: TinyMedal, Tempt Sword, Potion

 The tower is simple enough.  Your goal is to reach the top (obviously),
and there are a few very easy-to-reach switches along the way that you need
to hit.  There are no real puzzles here, and the top floor is simple to
get to.  After you reach it, you'll discover that DarkDraco is out of
control, and the monsters are even afraid.  Not good.  Go talk to the
monsters to fight them, then prepare for a battle with DarkDraco itself.

BOSS: DarkDraco		Suggested Level: 24-30
HP: 1600
Strategy: Standard boss tactics (heal as required, use best attacks).  Need
I really say more?  Seriously, DarkDraco is the most by-the-books boss in
the entire game.

 After the fight, the light will return, and Loomin is all happy-happy joy-
joy.  Might as well return to the present version of Loomin.  However, upon
arriving, you'll discover that it's been destroyed!  D'oh!  Better head
back in time to fix that.  First, though, grab the TinyMedal in the well,
then pay a visit to the building that has sprung up nearby.

Location: Monster Park
Items: Slime Clothes

 Some people are terribly ambitious, aren't they?  This place is home to a
man who wants to build up a monster park.  Talk to him, and he will give
you the BeefJerky.  Now, using the Tamer skill, you can recruit monsters
for his park.  You can only catch one of each at first, and they rarely
come along unless you use Tamer on them a few times, but at least the
option's open to you now.  Go pay the modern DarkDraco's tower a visit,
too.

Location: DarkDraco's Tower
Monsters: Same as in past
Gold: 280G
Items: TinyMedal, Lipsy Heart, ? Shard (1 Mimic)

 Little has changed here.  Get the stuff, head back in time to Loomin to
save them yet again.  As you enter Loomin, you'll see that the town has
been taken over by none other than HellVine!  Rather predictably, the end
of the eternal night heralded its return.  Fight off the vines holding the
townspeople, then make your way to the manor.  Go upstairs and talk to the
guy who lives there.  He suggests that you go underground.  The well would
be ideal for that.  Head there, and into HellVine's lair.

Location: HellVine's Lair
Monsters: DragonMan, ShadeNite, BabyDevil, VineRoot
Gold: 630G
Items: Steel Sword, Devil Armor

 Follow the vines to reach the boss.  You may want to take the side-paths
to grab what few items are down here, too.  Once you reach HellVine, you'll
have to fight it (naturally).

BOSS: HellVine		Suggested Level: 24-30
HP: 1,600	Item: WindShard
Strategy: He's just a normal boss.  Deal with him the way you deal with any
other boss.

 After HellVine is down, the town is saved!  Right?  If you want, you can
go visit the guy in the mansion to see his new little pet, a cute little
insect called Chibi.  Well, now that that's over, let's go check out the
present Loomin.  What, it's still destroyed?!  This town really is cursed.
Go back to Loomin in the past to find out what's up.

 Talk around with the people in town, and you'll discover that people are
nervous about Chibi, the cute little worm that the manor owner found
earlier.  They're afraid that the little bug is going to destroy the town.
But that can't be the case, now can it?  The guy who lives in that house
seems to have a knack for taming monsters.  Go and talk to him, and see the
townspeople prove their paranoia.  Go outside and talk to the group of
people.  Now you have a decision to make, one that will actually affect
what happens next (which is extremely rare, for a Dragon Quest game).

 On the one hand, you can agree to slay Chibi.  On the other, you can
refuse.  Consider the evidence before you: Chibi has grown large, but other
than defending his master, he hasn't caused anybody harm.  If you choose to
kill Chibi, then Loomin is screwed.  If you choose not to, then you've made
the right choice.

 I will assume that you've figured out that you should not kill Chibi, and
thus guide you.  Return to see the monster-loving man, warn him of the
villagers' plan, and he'll tell you that he's going to release Chibi.
Follow him to the hill, and watch him let little Chibi go.  Back in Loomin,
leave the manor.  The town is under attack by HellWorms!  Fight off the
ones that are wandering about, then once one of your allies mentions
Sieble, head for the manor and defend the owner from the HellWorm attacking
him.  Hurry outside of the mansion, avoiding the HellWorms wandering about,
and watch as Chibi saves the day.  The town is saved from the invading
HellWorms, and Chibi is celebrated as a hero.  At last, Loomin is
completely saved!  Note that the weapon and armor shops now sell stuff
(same as the present version).

 If you decided (foolishly) to kill Chibi, then the following will occur:
you'll stay at the inn, and sneak in to kill Chibi late at night.  Once you
do kill it, the HellWorms will attack, but this time, Chibi won't be there
to save the village.  You'll be sent into the well for the duration of the
attack, and when you're allowed to leave the well, the town will be in
ruins.  That's what you get for killing an innocent little insect.  You
bug-slaying meanie.

 Anyway, go visit the present version of Loomin (at last).

Location: Loomin
Gold: 550G*
Items: TinyMedal, Tights, Traveler Clothes, Copper Sword*, Leather Armor,
SilkTux, Repellent (1 MadBook)
Weapon Shop: Flame Fist, Hacksaw, Ice Fist, War Hammer
Armor Shop: Wizard Robe, Silver Armor, Heavy Armor, Dragon Shield,
Expel Shield, IronMask

 Note that the TinyMedal here was the one in the well, so if you got it
earlier (when the town was still a ruin), you won't be able to get it now.
Raid the town's chests and vases, and talk to the people around town.  It
seems that people think that Chibi was human, and one guy is even claiming
that he's a descendant of him (hehehe...).  Well, with that complete, it's
time to move on to the next area.


Deception and Fate					[D1PROBINA]
-----------------==

PEDESTAL: Probina (Wind room, upper right)
PIECES: Litorud (present; in a chest in the doctor's basement), Baloch

after the flood)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 39

 Cross the bridge here, and head east and north to the little town of
Probina.

 What a peaceful place.  There's not much to see, but why complain about
that?  If you ask around town, you'll discover that the only real dilemma
here is that some place called Raguraz is apparently threatening the
village with hollow promises of war.  The central conflict seems to be some
statue of a goddess.  Might as well visit the temple and find out what this
is about (after looting the town, of course).

Location: Mountain Path
Monsters: NailMan, Dragon, SlimeLv8, ShadeNite, EvilBook, Stalker,
Armorgon, BabyDrak, Banegaroo
Gold: 530G
Items: Florajay Heart, (1 Cannibox)

 Unfortunately, there's a bit of a dungeon before you can reach the Mt.
Probina temple.  It's pretty straightforward, though.  Be sure to grab the
items on the path.

Location: Mt. Probina Temple
Items: Repellent

 The temple has a lovely view of the surrounding area, but that's not
really why we're up here.  There's a spring in back of the temple, which
will restore your HP and MP if you use it.  Go into the temple, and grab
the Repellent in the side room before seeing the priest.  One of the two
nuns in the righthand room will let you save your game if you talk to her.
Upon seeing the priest, you'll witness the son of the village chief doing a
very rash thing.  Speak with the priest and Ordeaux before you go to
the bridge.

 At the bridge, Razuel will prove himself a complete idiot, and the
monsters will attack Probina.  Head back there, and before you continue,
talk to the shopkeeper of the weapon store.  This will net you the game's
only Platinum Sword (well, unless you want to build a super bazaar town out
of your immigrant town later).  Anyway, make your way back up Mt. Probina.
Talk to the elder to warn him of what's going on, then make your way up to
the temple proper.

Location: Mt. Probina Temple
New Items: MoonHerb, LifeAcorn

 Talk to the priest there, then follow him.  Follow him and Razuel to the
cellar, and go down into it yourself.  Grab the stuff down here, then go
talk to Razuel.  A battle will commence outside, and the results will be
pretty obvious.  Go follow Razuel down through the village, grab the chest
that he dropped, and show him the GoddessPic.  The hint he gives you is
pretty obvious.  Go gather the two pieces of the Goddess Statue from the
bridge, then take them to the spring behind the temple on Mt. Probina.  Of
course, no respectable monster boss would let you get away with that.
DragonMan will attack you.  You cannot win against him at first, but fear
not; after a few turns, Razuel will come to your rescue!  You'll be fully
healed, and the boss will be severely weakened.  Now you can win the fight.

BOSS: DragonMan		Suggested Level: 25-30
HP: 1,000
Strategy: Now that he's mortal, he's pretty easy.  Standard boss tactics
will suffice.

 Unfortunately, the boss will destroy the Goddess Statue after you defeat
him.  So typical of those evil types.  Talk to Razuel after the fight, and
follow him outside.  Now, head back to Probina for a happy ending to this
strange little chapter in the game's story.  Head back to the present, and
visit modern Probina.

Location: Probina

 The town remains more or less unchanged.  Loot it, then head up the path
to the temple.

Location: Mountain Path
Items: Lipsy Heart, LandShard, (1 Cannibox)

 I think you can figure this one out on your own.  Agree to help the old
man up to the temple.

Location: Mt. Probina Temple
Items: WindShard, TinyMedal

 Grab everything here, then move on to the next area.  Isn't it nice to not
have a quest to do in the present for a change?

(NOTE: There's a side-quest available at this point.  Return to Hamelia and
talk to Azmov.  After that, visit Litorud, and check the Intelligence Rank
scores.  Go visit Dharma's bandits, and talk to Epong.  This will net you
the Lore Hat.  Try to return it to Azmov and Beck, and Azmov will let you
keep it.)


The Madness of Zeppel					[D1MARDRA]
--------------------==

PEDESTAL: Mardra (Fire room, lower left)
PIECES: Hamelia (present; in Dr. Azmov's store room), Underwater City
(present; in a chest in one of the buildings near the entrance), World's
Tallest Tower (comes with Melvin)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 41

Location: Mardra Area		Suggested Level: 24-30
Monsters: FoggyPot, BabyDevil, DragonMan, Red Sting, MetlRider

 Go check out the nearby castle.

Location: Raguraz
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb
Armor Shop: Steel Armor, Silver Apron, Heavy Armor, Iron Shield,
White Shield, Iron Helmet, IronMask

 If you've been to Probina, then this place's name might ring a bell.  But
from the looks of it, they're not even remotely the threat that Probina's
citizens made them out to be.  According to the castle's population, they
were recently decimated by a country called Mardra.  It might be worthwhile
to visit that place, and see what's going on.  Head south from Raguraz to
find it.

Location: Mardra
Gold: 5G
Items: Magic Shield**, Horned Hat, MysticNut, Bow Tie, Potion (1 MadBook)
Equipment Shop: Pixy Sword, Lune Fan, Ice Fist, Skirt, Magic Armor,
Magic Shield, Silver Tiara
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, SpiderWeb, Repellent, BunnyTail

 NOTE: A ** indicates that a chest requires the Magic Key to unlock.

 Mardra doesn't seem all that bad, at a glance.  The people are amazingly
elitist, but other than that, they seem pretty nice.  The people are almost
all upset at the king's continued increase in military size, which suggests
that something is amiss.  Head for the castle.

Location: Mardra Castle
Gold: 250G, 13G, 310G**
Items: STRseed, LightAqua, Evade Clothes**, Empress Letter, MysticNut**

 The castle is pretty damn big, and if anything, the people here are even
more elitist than they are in town.  Lie to the guards and tell them you're
the messenger from Medille.  Avoid the entrance hall until you've visited
all of the towers, talked to everybody, and gotten every treasure.  To get
the LightAqua, walk up from the statue through the northern doorway, then
head through the western doorway to the eastern one.  Be sure to get the
Empress Letter from the old queen in the white tower.  Once you have all of
the items, go talk to the guard at the entryway.  You'll get kicked out,
but that's not such a big deal.  Head for the roadblock, and show them the
Empress Letter.  Then, continue onwards to the Great Fane.

Location: Great Fane
Gold: 6G
Items: MysticNut, Potion, TinyMedal
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, SpiderWeb, Repellent, BunnyTail,
GuardRuby

 Quite a fane, isn't it?  Loot the place, then go see the priest on the
second floor.  To get to the stairway in the middle of the fane, start at
the western entrance (where the statue is), head to the east side, loop
around to the top, and finish off by going through the south entrance.  The
head priest will ask you to go hunt down a StarShard for him, from the cave
to the west.  Head there now.

Location: Basin Cave/Lake
Monsters: DarkThief, KilStar, VenomHork, Red Sting, LizrdBird, BabyDevil,
Armorgon, SheepBird
Items: Herb, StarShard

 The cave is simple enough.  The path is straightforward, so no walkthrough
is necessary.  Once you reach the exit, you'll be at Basin Lake.  Head on
over to the hut (since the path forward is closed).  Talk to the hobbit
there, then talk to his wife and agree to stay.  Head out to the waterfall,
and cross over to the second half of Basin Cave.  The path here is also
very straightforward.  The StarShard is at the top of the cliff, easily
accessible.  Once you have that, head back to the Great Fane and deliver it
to the high priest.  He'll give you the Priest Letter, which will let you
get back into the castle, and into Mardra's Magic Research Institute.

 Go into the Magic Research Institute, and talk to the folks there.  It
seems that the king is still researching the Ultimate Magic.  Well, at
least he hasn't succeeded yet.  Head for the castle, and watch as a little
girl's magic goes crazy.  A strange cloaked man will help her up, then
attempt to cast Blazemost on her.  What a bastard.  The girl will be saved
by a priest called Dino, then the cloaked guy runs off to the castle.  Go
talk to Dino, and he'll tell you the past of king Zeppel and himself, and
of the Raguraz invasion of ten years ago.  Whoo, heavy.  Head for the
castle now.

Location: Mardra Castle
New Items: TinyMedal

 They can't refuse your entry because of that letter, so go on in.  Go see
the king now.  The stranger is there, and he gives the king something.  How
suspicious.  Before you speak with Zeppel, head downstairs and raid his
bedroom.  Once you have the TinyMedal, then speak with him.  He'll tell you
off, and ask you to tell the priest to leave him alone.  Antisocial, isn't
he?  You might as well go back and tell the high priest.  One of his
messengers will show up just as you leave the castle bridge area asking you
to return anyway.

 Talk to the high priest, and watch as he fails.  He tells you to go back
and keep an eye on Zeppel.  These people are so demanding...  Go on back to
Mardra.  You'll encounter the Medille messenger, who turns out to be a
monster.  He's pretty easy to kill, so don't fret.  After the fight, head
to the Magic Research Institute, and go watch Dino force his way in.  Go
follow him.  Head downstairs, and watch as Zeppel goes insane.  Go follow
him back to the bridge.  Zeppel attacks you!  You cannot win this fight
without a whole lot of preparation, and it doesn't change a thing if you
do, so don't bother trying (unless you're really bored, I guess).
Fortunately, the high priest comes and saves you.  Go follow him up to the
castle, and up to the balcony.  Talk to him, and he'll try to cast Majustis
on Zeppel.  It's semi-effective, but that's enough for us to beat Zeppel.
Go down and fight him.

BOSS: Zeppel		Suggested Level: 26-31
HP: 2,000
Strategy: Zeppel is no joke.  Be sure to make healing your top priority.
You may even want to set your best healer to the Heal AI setting.  Other
than that, Zeppel is a standard boss.

 After the fight, Dino works to make everything better.  The next morning,
after the cutscene, talk to Zeppel.  Go down and talk to the staff maker's
assistant for a free Bolt Staff.  Now, make your way back to the Great Fane
and talk to the high priest.  He'll promise to teach you Majustis once he
finishes it.  Great, that'll be in about twenty years...  No matter, return
to the present version of Mardra.

Location: Mardra

Steel Whip
Armor Shop: Silver Armor, Skirt, Magic Armor, Spirit Armor, Magic Shield,
Dragon Shield, Silver Tiara

 The town has changed only in interests.  Now people are elitist about
music instead of magic.  People are all talking about some guy called
Johann, who apparently made a big scene at a funeral by playing a festival
song recently.  Sounds like a funny guy.  Grab the stuff lying about town,
then head for the castle.

Location: Mardra Castle
Items: Party Dress, DEFseed, (1 Mimic)

 The castle has actually changed quite a bit, in terms of the interior.
The people here are all musicians.  At the moment, there's nothing much to
do here, so just grab everything and leave.

Location: Great Fane
Items: WindShard, TinyMedal, MysticNut

 Loot the place, and be sure to check out the high priest's grave.  This
will net you Majustis!  Now, for an interesting trick: go back to see the
high priest of the past, and show him Majustis (you'll need to have enough
MP to cast it; it only costs 15 MP, though).  Then, check his grave in the
present again to learn Gigastis!  Convenient!  Well, now that that's over,
head for the next area.


 NOTE: The following will occur only after the above three quests are
finished.  Be sure to unequip Maribel and put all of her items into the Bag
before you return to the present from the last area that you do!

 As you return to the Fane, Maribel will say that she's tired, and wants to
go home.  You'll automatically be taken outside of the fane, where a fellow
from Fishbel will show up and tell you that Maribel's father has fallen
ill.  This is why you should unequip Maribel before you return to the
present; otherwise, she'll leave and keep everything you equipped on her in
her inventory.  Go see Maribel in Fishbel.  Her father is apparently very
ill, indeed.  Talk to her, but she doesn't have much to say.  Go see
Borkano, and he'll tell you that the Dejans have reappeared on their
continent.  Why not go pay them a visit?

Location: Dejan Camp
Gold: 60G
Items: LifeAcorn x2, TinyMedal, Rib

 The camp setup hasn't changed in centuries, apparently.  Nab everything
and talk to everybody.  Apparently, the new dancer for the Dejan tribe is
being decided, and her name is Aira (shouldn't that be Ayla?).  Go talk to
the guard of the main tent to get things moving again.  Go inside the tent
and talk to the elder and his wife.  Aira doesn't respect the traditions of
the Dejans, obviously.  Go track her down.  Head south past the horses of
the camp, and follow the mountain range north to the cliff nearby.  Talk to
Aira.  She's not very nice, is she?  Go on back to the camp, and visit the
chief's tent.  Agree to go with Aira, and talk to her and her parents.
Talk to her again and agree to set off.  Aira will be given the TerraTula,
and guide you to sleep out under the stars with her (after she grabs her
family sword).  After this, Aira will officially join your party.  She also
gives you a WindShard (which is the critical last piece for accessing
Gorges).

 Now, take Aira to Mardra Castle, and talk to the princess.  Agree to her
idea of a music contest.  It's going to be a while before that occurs, but
it's best to get it out of the way now.  This would be a good time to get
both Aira and Melvin competent in a few classes.  You don't have to, of
course, but with Maribel gone, you've likely suffered a blow to your
ability to damage enemies.  Also, if you want, you can take Aira to see the
king of Estard, as well as the hero's family.  Anyway, once you're
satisfied with your party's capabilities, head for the next pedestal.


The Wind and the Winged Ones				[D1GORGES]
---------------------------==

PEDESTAL: Gorges (Wind room, lower right)
PIECES: Mezar Fane (in a chest in the fane), Probina Temple (present; in
the chest in the cathedral's left room), Loomin Cave (past; won from
HellVine), Great Fane (present; in one of the chests in the hidden
graveyard), Deja Camp (given to you by Aira)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 44

Location: Gorges Area		Suggested Level: 27-32
Monsters: Chargon, TreeGuard, Vulgarian, WonderEgg, JunkMech, SlimeWing,
Quixotron, SnowBat

 Take the short hike up to Gorges, the village nestled around the river.

Location: Gorges
Gold: 210G**, 20G, 3G
Items: BluePrint, TinyMedal, Pot Lid**, Boomerang, Rib
Weapon Shop: Dragon Tail, Fire Fist, Pixy Sword, War Hammer,
Flame Boomerang
Armor Shop: Skirt, Magic Armor, Spirit Armor, Angel Robe, White Shield,
Magic Shield, Expel Shield

 The people of Gorges are a bit different: they all have wings!  Gather the
resources around town, and talk to the folks here.  You'll find a wingless
girl called Firia (shouldn't that be Filia?) on the far side of the river,
being taunted by some little jerks.  Talk to them to get them to leave her
alone.  In the Pendragon's house (on the first side of the river), you'll
see the Pendragon fighting with his mother over the BlissRock.  Hmm, that
sounds familiar...  Talk to the Pendragon, and agree to help him out.
After that, head for the other side of Gorges, and on north to the small
village.

Location: Guardian Village
Items: DEFseed (1 EvilWell)

 Not much to see here.  Head into the house at the far end of the village,
and watch as a Lefan delivers some bad news.  The Fane's still lost to
them, and their hope is waning.  Talk to the leader, and he'll tell you
that you won't be able to explore the entire Fane yourself.  That's okay,
we'll be back.  Head for the cave in front of the Fane.

Location: Dark Cloud Maze
Monsters: DarkThief, VenomHork, Boarenger, ClawBeast
Items: Potion, TinyMedal, WorldLeaf, Bolt Staff, (1 Mimic)

 NOTE: Grab everything in this dungeon before completing it!

 The maze is pretty simple for the first few areas.  The third area (with
the pitch-black floor and statues) is a small puzzle.  The solution is to
always go exactly the opposite direction that the statue faces when you
use the Look command on it.  Once you've reached the end of this, you're
almost out of the maze.  Just go talk to the monster up ahead and fight it.

BOSS: HellGenie		Suggested Level: 28-33
HP: 2,500
Strategy: Is it just me, or are bosses getting way too much HP all of a
sudden?  Anyway, other than his ability to do obscenely high damage to
single characters, he is really not that difficult.  Standard boss tactics
will see you through this.

 After you win, the way out of the maze is opened, and you can make your
way into the fane.

Location: Wind Fane
Monsters: MagWyvern, SnowBat, TrickBag, Red Sting, EvilArmor
Gold: 350G
Items: LifeAcorn, TinyMedal, Wyvern Heart, DEFseed, (1 Mimic)

 The Fane's deserted, but you already knew that.  Raid the storeroom in the
back of the first floor of the Fane, then head upstairs via the east
staircase.  On the third floor, the first rotating wall shows up.  Just
examine the switch on the floor and press it to rotate the walls.  Take the
first stairwell up on this floor, and head into the next area, through the
halls, to the BlissRock room.  Grab the BlissRock, then head back for
Gorges.  Go into the Pendragon's house, and listen in on Firia and her
grandmother.  The plot thickens...  Talk to the Pendragon's mother, and the
Pendragon will return.  Give him the BlissRock.  After the celebrations,
head for the Pendragon's house.  Listen in on the argument between the
Pendragon and his mother.  Hm, the plot thickens even more...  Talk to the
Pendragon to get an AGL Scarf.  Some reward...  Go find Firia on the far
side of the river now.

 As you try to enter the path up the cliff, the wind dies down.  Aw, crap.
Go see the Pendragon's mother, and then go find Firia (she's up on the
cliff).  Go try and save Firia, and watch as the BlissRock works its magic.
Not bad, huh?  Go down and talk to her, then head back to the Pendragon's
house.  Talk to the Pendragon's mother again, and she'll reveal the truth
about Firia.  After the Pendragon gets berated a bit, Firia will join your
party (though not as an active member).  Head for the Wind Fane again.

 Now that Firia is with you, you can explore the rest of the Fane.  Head on
through like you did before, but this time, put the BlissRock back on its
pedestal, and have Firia open the door in that room for you.  The puzzle
of how to get the wind flow to hit the statue is simple enough.  As long as
you use your head, you shouldn't have any trouble.  Once the statue is
cleared of the dark cloud, a new threat will descend.  Since Firia's gone
to get the BlissRock, that leaves us to go out there and beat him up.

BOSS: HellCloud		Suggested Level: 28-33
HP: 3,000
Strategy: Now is when your class abilities will really make or break you.
HellCloud hits hard, and he can summon allies who can put you to sleep, as
well.  To succeed against this evil stratos-dweller, you'll want to have
some heavy-hitting skills, as well as some skills that can hit all enemies
(such as RockThrow; don't use any wind-elemental moves on HellCloud, he's
immune to them).  Having HealUs for at least one ally is also helpful, and
be sure that the ally casting it has the most HP (since a dead healer is
not much help).  If you're feeling daring, or just don't want to level up
your classes a lot, the Shepherd's Stampede skill can do a lot of damage
when it connects, and the Bard's MistSong skill can keep those BabyClouds
from casting SleepAll on you.  A mastered Cleric character with HealAll can
take the role of the healer, but be sure you set their AI to Heal!  This
fight can be very long indeed if you don't prepare properly for it.

 Once HellCloud is down, the darkness lifts, and the wind starts up again!
Well, that's a relief.  Firia will return now with the BlissRock, so let's
head back to Gorges.  Go see the Pendragon, of course.  If you take the
quick way down the cliff, you'll see a scene where one of the boys who was
picking on Firia earlier says he's not going to any longer.  Well, at least
he's maturing.  Anyway, at the Pendragon's house, Firia's grandma gets an
idea.  Go outside and see what it is.  Afterwards, Firia gives the
BlissRock to you.  Well, that's a good thing.  Now, back to the present,
and on to Gorges of modern times.

Location: Gorges
Gold: 540G**, 320G**, 10G
Items: Tray Shield**, Glam Clothes**, LifeAcorn
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, Repellent, WarpWing
Weapon Shop: Dragon Tail, Flame Fist, Pixy Sword, War Hammer,
Flame Boomerang
Armor Shop: Skirt, Magic Armor, Spirit Armor, Angel Gown, White Shield,
Magic Shield, Expel Shield

 Firia would fit in much better here; nobody has wings any longer.  As
well, the Pendragon isn't taking visitors.  Loot the town, then head for
the Fane.

Location: Lefa Fane
Items: TinyMedal x2, Rib, LifeAcorn, AquaShard, WorldDew, LandShard,
 (2 MadBook)

 The Fane hasn't changed much, either.  Gather the stuff, check out the
portal that leads back to the Ancient Fane on the roof, then head for the
Falrod continent.  There's a Fane we visited there earlier that we need to
return to now, since we have the BlissRock.  Go into the Coral Lake Shrine,
and talk to the soldier on the second floor.  Head downstairs, and through
the previously locked door to the Coral Lake.

Location: Coral Cave
Items: BluePrint, ? Shard

 The path through is straightforward.  Be sure you nab the items here, and
once you reach the end, use the BlissRock while standing on the crest in
the final area to get the platform to the Sky Fane to descend.  Ride it up
to the fane in the sky.

Location: Sky Fane
Items: Innocent Clothes

 At the moment, you can't do much here.  Head inside.  Upstairs, the dancer
at the desk will give you the Innocent Clothes.  The people here are all a
bit uneasy, and understandably so.  You can ride the pedestal that brought
you up here to the second Fane, which contains the Ressurection Pedestal.
Unfortunately, you only have one of the three pieces for it.  You'll have
to come back later to complete it.  For the time being, return to the
Ancient Fane, and on to Labres.  Fortunately, when the time comes that you
have to come back here, you can access it from the Return menu.


Sins of the Fathers					[D1LABRES]
------------------==

PEDESTAL: Labres (Land room, upper right)
PIECES: Brugeo's Manor (in a chest in the basement), Mountain Path
(present; in a chest on the third floor), Loomin Hill (past; on top of
HellVine's grave), Lefa Fane (present; on the platform where the BlissRock
used to be)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 47

Location: Labres Area		Suggested Level: 28-33
Monsters: ClawBeast, MagWyvern, MageLipsy, Devilite, PuppetMan, Flamzard

 Not much to see here.  First things first, go south to the pass nearby,
and defend the poor sop getting attacked.  Now, go visit the nearby
village.

Location: Labres
Items: TinyMedal, MysticNut
General Store: Herb, Antidote, War Hammer, Seduce Sword, Flame Boomerang,
White Shield

 The people here are paranoid and violent.  Not a good combo, especially if
you're a traveler visiting the area.  Go visit the Prefect's house, on the
northeast hill of the town.  The Prefect will call you inside, and ask you
to explain the situation to him.  Talk to him, and agree to help for now.
Go visit the temple graveyard.  Go follow the monster/priest into the
temple, and talk to him.  He doesn't seem to be a monster at all, despite
his appearance.  Go visit the kid living in the wood hut below the temple.
His name is Lukas, and he seems to be the most rational person in the town.
Check out the Goddess Statue, and talk to Lukas again.  He seems to have
his doubts about the evilness of the monster/priest.  Go back to the
Prefect's house.

 There's a meeting that's about to start.  Talk to the Prefect to initiate
it.  Talk to the people once the meeting has started to find out what they
think, then talk to Lukas.  Follow him, and talk to him.  Talk to the
Prefect, and they'll decide on their course of action.  Good thing they're
such cowards, or there wouldn't be time to intervene and stop them.  Go
upstairs, and rest up.  Talk to the Prefect, and tell him you are ready.
Refuse to help kill the monster.  They'll lock you in the shed (how the
HELL can a bunch of cowardly villagers overpower a group of highly armed
and trigger-happy warriors such as your party, anyway?).  Try to open the
door to the shed.  Tell the girl you'll behave, then go outside and find
Lukas.  He'll beg you to help him show some reason to those big-headed
morons that want to kill the priest.  Go ahead and try that (after you've
talked to Lukas and had him join the party).

 The men of the village are up at the church, beating up the monster.
Heartless bastards.  Just goes to show who the REAL monsters around here
are.  Go try and intervene.  They'll once again subdue you (I still want to
know how they're able to do this), and toss you on Mt. Tor.

Location: Mt. Tor
Monsters: Gron, Berserker, Pigady, WingTiger, DumbiKing, TigerMage,
PuppetMan, Devilite
Gold: 650G
Items: STRseed, BluePrint, TinyMedal, Rib, (1 Mimic)

 Fortunately, this is exactly where you want to be.  Since the path back to
the village is cut off, head up the mountain instead, all the way to the
summit.  Of course, you should pick up the items in the caves along the
way.  Anyway, once at the summit, you'll shave to fight the monsters'
leader.

BOSS: Botok		Suggested Level: 29-34
HP: 2,500
Strategy: Standard boss tactics.  That sums it up nicely.  He's annoying,
but far from impossible.  If you can beat HellCloud, you can easily beat
this guy.

 After Botok's defeat, the fog lifts.  Talk to Lukas, then leave the
mountain and return to Labres.  Don't worry, the game will automatically
take you to the world map once you try to go down the ladder.  Anyway, in
Labres, go down into the center of the village, where they've crucified the
innocent priest (who, for some reason, is still in the monster's guise).
These people are fanatical, I'd say.  Fortunately, Lukas stops them before
they can hurt the innocent priest.  Talk to Lukas, and just then, the spell
on the priest fails.  Talk to him again, and watch the ensuing cutscenes.
Go to the Prefect, and talk to him.  Now, go back to the temple, and the
priest will join you, asking you to take him to the village's entrance.  Do
so, and watch what little story scenes remain for this chapter of the game.
Now, go visit modern Labres.  (NOTE: If you're wondering, the pass to the
south leads to Dune, but it's the same Dune as the one you visited through
its own pedestal.  There's nothing new there.)

Location: Labres
Items: MysticNut, Rib, AquaShard, DEFseed, Bunny Ears, TinyMedal x5
General Store: Herb, Antidote, War Hammer, Seduce Sword, Flame Boomerang,
Dragon Armor, Expel Shield

 The people here haven't wised up any since their ancestors' time.  If
anything, their heads are now even more bloated due to their misconception
of who was attacking who during that last saga you just completed.  There's
only two people in town who aren't behaving like idiots, and everybody else
in town treats them like dirt.  So typical...  Anyway, grab the items in
town (check Colin the Adventurer's grave twice for the TinyMedals), and
talk to Lief in his house.  His family (who obviously descended from Lukas)
all know the true story of Labres, but nobody believes them.  Go talk to
the Prefect, but he doesn't believe you, either.  Pompous self-righteous
jerks...  Go talk to the kid guarding the basement of the Prefect's house,
and agree to his terms.  Inside, agree to help Sazumu, and help him unearth
the item in the pit.  It's the monument that should be in the village
square!

 This monument tells the true story.  Boy, somebody along the line of those
villagers was really a jackass, rewriting history just to put themselves in
a better light.  You'll automatically take the monument to the elder, who
(being a particularly pompous jackass) destroys it.  Go under the house and
talk to the kids there.  Well, at least the next generation of Labres won't
be taken by the lies.  Now that that's done, you can go to where Mt. Tor
used to be, if you want to.  It's a shop now.

Location: Mountain Store
Weapon Shop: Flame Fist, Pixy Sword, Lune Fan, Ice Fist
Armor Shop: Magic Armor, Skirt, Angel Gown, White Shield, Magic Shield

 Other than the shops, there's really nothing here.  Go and unlock the
final piece of sealed land, the town of Coastal.


The Sealed Town of Coastal				[D1COASTAL]
-------------------------==

PEDESTAL: Coastal (Aqua room, lower right)
PIECES: Sphinx (present; in the same room as the archaeologist on the fifth
floor), Lefa Fane (present; in a chest in the store room), Labres (present;
in a chest in the general store)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 50

Location: Coastal Area		Suggested Level: 29-34
Monsters: EvilArmor, Ogreling, Clawser, WoodyEye, FooHero, FooMage,
FoFighter, Confupeng, Parasnail

 Finally, the last pedestal in the Ancient Fane...  As usual, go straight
to the castle-town, which is to the north.

Location: Coastal
Items: Pirate Clothes, TinyMedal, Captain Hat, ? Shard
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent
Weapon Shop: Bounce Sword, Lune Fan, Tempt Sword, Steel Whip, Monster Fist,
Dragon Sword
Armor Shop: Dragon Armor, Water Robe, Ice Shield, Expel Shield,
Captain Hat, Viking Helmet

 The town seems pretty gloomy, but that's normal for towns under the seal
of the Demon Lord.  It also seems to be very well protected, so it's very
doubtful that they're under siege.  Talk to the folks around town to see if
you can extract some information (and raid their homes for items, of
course).  One of the people down in the inn's pub will tell you that the
innkeeper is probably at the temple.  Once you've had your lot of this town
and it's people, seek her out.  She can't let you stay without the king's
permission, so you'd better go see him.  He agrees to let you stay, though
the minister seems to be uneasy about it.  Go ahead and go stay at the inn.

 During the night, a scream will awaken the party.  Head downstairs, and
outside the inn.  After the scene, go to the castle and upstairs into
Anise's bedroom.  If you talk to Anise, she will mistake you for Sharkeye.
Strange.  Go out on the balcony and talk to the bard there.  He'll tell you
of the history of Sharkeye and his crew, and their relations with Coastal.
After the long cutscenes, go back to the inn and back to sleep.  You'll be
woken up by a summons by the king, so you'd best go visit him.  Before
that, though, go into the house that you couldn't access the previous
night, and push on the bookshelf to get out to the chest with the ? Shard
in it.

 Anyway, the king has a plan.  He wants you to get some Glim Moss from the
halflings on the other side of the mountain.  Go ahead and set out for the
halflings' cave.  If you want, you can talk to the people in town a bit
first.  When your curiosity's slaked, head on to the cave.

Location: Halfling Cave
Monsters: WoodyEye, JewelBag, Poucher, FooHero, FoFighter, FooMage,
FooPriest, Ogreling, ButchMan
Items: TinyMedal, WorldDew, BluePrint**, Viking Helmet**, STRseed

 The cave is easy to navigate, so I'll assume you can figure it out.  The
fourth floor down is the colony itself, where everything seems to be okay
(until you arrive, at least).  Go visit the Grand Halfling, and he'll let
you talk to him; do so.  He'll tell you where to find the Glim Moss: deeper
in the cave.  Go ahead and go down there.  You'll have to fight a monster
(three, actually) to get to the moss, though.  They're not that tough,
though the seahorse ones can put you to sleep (annoying bastards) and
breathe flame and ice breath.  WoolGuard would be a good idea.  Once the
enemies are down, grab some Glim Moss.  Now is the time to return to
Coastal, and deliver it.

 You'll arrive just in time to use the moss.  Walk up to the monster, and
after a short cutscene, use the Glim Moss on it.  Now there is a clear
trail out of town to lead you to the monsters' den.  After you've been
forced to rest up, the king will tell you that you'll need RainbwDew to
extinguish the flame.  Remember waaaaaay back in Engow, when I suggested
that you gather some water from the Estard lagoon?  Now you finally have a
use for it!  I'll suggest it again now, in case you didn't do it then: get
some of the RainbwDew from the small lagoon outside of the cave that the
blue teleporter in the Ancient Fane leads to, via the Bottle item in your
inventory.  If you already did, then ignore that sentence.  Once you've
made preparations, head for the Great Lighthouse.

Location: Great Lighthouse
Monsters: Ogreling, Poucher, WingTiger, ButchMan, Tyranodon, Mettable,
Cannibox, Clawser, Tyrannodon, JewelBag
Items: Potion, TinyMedal, Devil Armor, Scarf, LifeAcorn, (1 MadPot,
2 Mimic)

 The path through the lighthouse is clearly outlined by the monster's
footprints.  If you want to risk getting some of the treasures, don't be
surprised if you end up falling a floor or two and having to re-climb the
lighthouse.  They'll still be there after the darkness lifts, so don't feel
pressured to get them now.  Anyway, reaching the top should be no trouble.
Up there, use the RainbwDew on the dark flame (this might seem familiar;
you had to do a similar thing in Engow).  This opens a gate to the real
source of trouble, the Mysterious World, Beli Mawr's lair.  Head in and
fight him.

BOSS: Beli Mawr		Suggested Level: 30-35
HP: 1,500	Item: ? Shard
Strategy: HellCloud was more of a pain than this guy, so as long as you can
adhere to the basic tactics of doing as much damage as possible and healing
when necessary, you are pretty much guaranteed to win.

 Upon defeating Beli Mawr, Coastal's curse is lifted.  Head back to Coastal
now.  Though the curse has been lifted, the darkness remains.  You need to
return the PilotFire to the Great Lighthouse.  Go talk to the king of
Coastal.  He'll give you the Coastal Letter, and ask you to go get the
PilotFire from Engow.  Of course, going to the present Engow is a waste of
time, so go see the elder in ancient Engow (in case you've forgotten, Engow
is the pedestal on the upper left in the fire room of the Ancient Fane).
Are you sick of going back to Engow so often?  'Cause I sure am...  Anyway,
show the elder the Coastal Letter, and he'll tell you to talk to somebody
downstairs about getting a PilotFire.  Talk to the man standing in front of
the torch, and he'll use that Bottle of yours (gets a lot of use, doesn't
it?) to put the PilotFire in.

 The fire in hand, go back to Coastal, and all the way back to the top of
the Great Lighthouse.  Use the PilotFire in front of the brazier, and the
light will return to this area.  Some Coastal soldiers will show up to
praise you, and the whole lot of you will return to the castle without you
having to guide your allies at all.  Once you're given control again, head
for the castle proper.  The people shower you with praise, and the king
will reward you with the incredibly powerful Aquagon Sword.  A bunch of
story scenes will progress (and observant players may spot a few links
between the hero and Coastal that others might miss).  After it's over, the
king of Coastal will suggest that you go visit the Grand Halfling.  Better
do that now.

Location: Halfling Cave
New Items: Sea Roar Staff, ? Shard, EvlTurtl Heart, Rib

 The Grand Halfling will grant you access to the treasure room.  Talk to
the guard of the treasures after this, and nab the stuff.  Now is as good
a time as any to return to the present, and visit the modern version of
Coastal.

Location: Coastal
Items: AmitSnack, TinyMedal
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, Repellent
Weapon Shop: Bounce Sword, Lune Fan, Seduce Sword, Monster Fist,
Flame Boomerang, Dragon Sword
Armor Shop: Viking Armor, Dragon Armor, Water Robe, Ice Shield,
Expel Shield, Captain Hat, Viking Helmet

 The town's structure remains unchanged (which is pretty common), but the
people are quite different.  The castle is now a casino, and the king lives
with the halflings.  If you talk to the sister managing the temple, she'll
tell you that the priest is out.  The casino might be worth checking out.
One of the bunny girls says that one of the regulars just walked out with
the top prize.  Interesting.  One of the people upstairs mentions that a
guy living behind the inn won a shard.  Might want to track him down, then.
He's walking around the escapeway, bragging.  Ask him for the shard, and
then track down the armorer.  Talk to his wife, and she'll say that he went
to check out the PilotFire about a month ago, and hasn't returned since.
Sheesh, what an idiot.  Might as well head there.

Location: Great Lighthouse
Monsters: LizardMan, MagicPost, EvlStatue, CloudKing, BabyCloud
Items: Antidote, Herb x2, WorldDew, LifeAcorn, TinyMedal, Potion, MysticNut

 The lighthouse hasn't changed one bit, except for the treasures (and the
monsters; they're a lot tougher now).  Gather the stuff up while you head
up.  The armorer is right up at the top, lying down near the PilotFire.
Talk to him, and he'll admit that he gave the shard to the priest.  Back to
Coastal, then...  Talk to the priest in the basement of the casino, who
denies all knowledge of the shard.  Quite a lowlife, isn't he?  Go upstairs
and talk to the sister in the room up there, as well as the priest.  It
seems that the shard is probably under his altar.  Go check there now, and
sure enough, there it is!  With the ? Shard finally in your inventory, why
not go pay a visit to the Halfling Cave?

Location: Halfling Cave
Gold: 30G, 120G, 50G, 16G
Items: Rib, TinyMedal, AmitDonut, PinkPearl, STRseed, Dung, Trendy Clothes,
MysticNut
Armor Shop: Slime Armor, Flame Shield, Flame Shield, Platinum Helmet
Weapon Shop: Dragon Sword, Flame Sword, Sear Roar Staff

 The path down is the same as ever.  Be sure to talk to the king of Coastal
before you leave, and get an ID Card.  Now you can get a free PuffPuff at
the casino, which (apparently) increases your luck at the slots.  Once you
have everything, depart forthwith from the cave.  At last, the world has
been entirely revived!  Now, to work on the last two pedestals.  Return to
the Sky Fane, and complete the pedestal there.


The Battle of the Demon Lord and God			[D1BATTLE]
-----------------------------------==

PEDESTAL: Ressurection Pedestal (Sky Fane)
PIECES: DarkDraco's Tower (present; right where DarkDraco was sitting),
Coastal (past; found in the castle), Halfling Cave (past; in a chest in the
Grand Halfling's room), Coastal (present; found at the altar of the church,
after completing the quest to find out where the shard went)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 0 (can't level up classes here)

 On the other side of the pedestal, enter the shrine.  You're back at the
fane that lead to the Sky Fane.  Go upstairs and talk to the old man up
there, then enter the Coral Lake once more.

Location: Coral Lake
Monsters: DeathCrab, PutreFish, Seahorser, Piranhan, Confupeng, Parasnail,
Multieyes, EvlAnchor, EvlTurtle

 The path through the Coral Lake is the same as it was before.  Most of the
chests are empty now, though.  Indeed, even though you opened them in the
present, the chests in the past seem to be opened, as well.  How odd!  At
the end, there's an altar (instead of just a crest on the ground, as it was
in the present).  Use the BlissRock on the crest up there.  At last, the
Sky Fanes have been ressurected!  Head back to the present version of the
Sky Fane, now.

Location: Sky Fane
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, Repellent, WarpWing
Weapon Shop: Zombie Sword, Dragon Claw, Thunder Sword
Armor Shop: Water Robe, Flame Armor, Princess Dress, Expel Shield,
Heal Shield, Mythril Helmet

 Now that the Fanes are all returned, you can buy equipment here.
Ridiculously overpriced equipment, but equipment nonetheless.  Check out
the two new Fanes, and talk around.  Be sure to speak to the high priestess
in the southern Fane.  She will call the Sky Rock to you.  At last, you
have the ability to travel anywhere in the world!  It's the stupidest
airship equivalent in all history, but who cares?  The Sky Stone's theme
song kicks ass, so it can look as hideous as it wants to.  The place we're
looking for is north of Hamelia, the Unknown Shrine deep in the mountains.

Location: Unknown Shrine
Items: TinyMedal, ? Shard

 Check the grave near the entrance (it's off to one side) for the TinyMedal
in this area, then go inside and talk to the man in there to get a ? Shard.
He'll tell you to go back to the excavation site on the Dejan continent.
First, though, if you want to view an extra scene or two, return to your
house in Fishbel.  There's a summons from the king, so you might as well go
visit him.  He'll basically tell you what you already know, but you may as
well do it.  Anyway, head for the site.  The people there are all freaking
out because of the newly opened cave.

Location: Excavated Cave
Items: TinyMedal

 NOTE: If you've been gathering and turning in TinyMedals consistently, the
medal down here should be enough to get you the MetlKing Shield, or if you
have gotten all of the medals from your town and the one at Sim's house,
the Bolero Robe.  You might as well get them now, as they'll help in the
coming fight.

 The cave is easy to traverse.  Most of it involves falling down holes and
climbing rock ladders.  Before you proceed down the flame-infested bridge
that leads to the last pedestal, be certain that you're ready for it, and
that you've saved.  Then, place your shards onto the pedestal...

PEDESTAL: Demon Lord's Pedestal (Excavated Cave)
PIECES: Coral Cave (in a chest in one of the areas), Great Lighthouse (won
from BeliMawr), Unknown Shrine (given to you by a cloaked man)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 50

 As you complete the pedestal, a cutscene begins, and you get to witness
first-hand the legendary battle between God and the Demon Lord.  Once this
is over, you'll be standing outside of the Demon Lord's Castle.

Location: Demon Lord's Castle	Suggested Level: 30-35
Monsters: MetalyS, Metabble, EvilViper, ProtoMech, EvilClown, FireCloud,
Mimic, OrcDevil, SheepDuck, CurseLamp, CureSlime
Items: (1 Mimic)

 Go ahead and enter, but beware: this is a very, very long dungeon.  The
massive number of encounterable enemies here holds testament to this.  If
you don't have decent class skills, get out of here now and go learn some
before you come back.  This is the point of no return for disc 1, after
all.

 The first floor's puzzle is simple: cross the invisible bridge.  Every
three seconds or so, it flickers and shows you how to cross it.  On the
second floor, head upwards to the far staircase to the third floor.  Head
south and walk up the stairs to the fourth floor.  Take either of the two
paths to the fifth floor, and take the stairs up to the sixth floor (the
chest here is a Mimic).  Take the stairway that's further south of the
chest, and to the right.  Up here, take the stairway down on the left, and
go straight forward to the stairway up.  Walk up the grand stairway.

 As you can see. you're now in a very strange place.  This is the throne
room of the Demon Lord, Orgo Demira (whom the game calls Orgodemir).  Walk
right on up to him, and give him what for.

BOSS: Orgo Demira (Orgodemir)	Suggested Level: 31-36
HP: 7,500
Strategy: This is it, the last big fight of disc 1.  Orgo Demira hits hard,
and hits multiple times.  Be sure to keep up with your healing, or you'll
be reduced to a fine paste rather quickly.  Indeed, you may want to set
your slowest ally to the Heal AI setting, just to be safe.  Use your best
attacks, and don't give this freak any quarter.  He has two forms, but
other than gaining a few new attacks, nothing varies between the forms.

 At last, the Demon Lord has been slain!  Depart forthwith from his blasted
lair.  His final ominous message may very well foreshadow what is to come
next.  Now, with the source of evil removed from this land, the lake altar
cave on the Dejan's continent has been unsealed from beneath the waves, and
the first disc has come to its end.  Save when the game prompts (if you so
desire).

 Prease insult disc 2.  Er, please insert disc 2.


=================--
Disc 2 Walkthrough
=================--

                Act IV - Light and Shadow Collide
               ==-------------------------------==

 NOTE: At this point, the level 36 class-leveling cap has been removed.  As
such, suggested levels will no longer be, er, suggested.  By now, your
class abilities should be powerful enough that your level doesn't matter.

Ressurection of the Fallen God				[D2REVIVAL]
-----------------------------==

 The game re-opens at the Sky Fane, where the high priestess is commending
you for your smashing good work in defeating Orgo Demira.  She'll then
instruct you to ressurect God.  Well, we've already got the first part of
that going now.  Remember the music contest in Mardra?  It's almost time
for that to commence.  Take the portal downstairs to the Ancient Fane, and
then go visit King Burns in Estard.  You'll have to intrude on him at
dinner, but that's okay.  Be sure you tell him that your quest isn't over,
and after the meeting, use Return to get to Mardra.  The contest isn't
actually at Mardra, though.  Go south to the Great Fane.

 Tell Michaela you're ready, and the contest will commence.  Sit back and
watch.  Once the contest is over, pay a visit to Johann's instructor, then
go to the to the Sacred Lake.  At the camp, you'll automatically be taken
to the elder.  He'll inform you that they're going to try and revive the
fallen God now, but advises you to rest first.  Go ahead and do that.

Location: Sacred Lake Altar Cave
Monsters: CureSlime, OrcDevil, Pigmon, Plesiodon, ClawBeast, EvilViper
Gold: 20G
Items: Herb, (1 Cannibox)

 You know this place well enough.  The place has not changed one bit since
the days of the previous Dejans, so feel free to look up there for a guide
to how to navigate the cave (though it shouldn't be required).  The chests
are still all empty from the last time you visited this cave, except for
one of them.  Once you've reached the bottom and placed the TerraBell, the
lake will drain (but of course).  Head out there, and talk to the chief.
Now commences the first FMV of disc 2, which might look just a bit
familiar.  Anyway, after some cutscenes, the chief sends you back to the
Ancient Fane.  Go on back to Fishbel and talk to Borkano and Mollie.  They
seem cheerful.  Note that if you try to visit Estard, but you'll be rudely
shoved off and told to go home.  Anyway, you can go and brag to Maribel if
you want, but to get things moving again, talk to the chef on Amitt's boat.
How is a sane person supposed to figure that out?  Seriously!

 Head back outside, and talk to the man guarding the stairs.  Johann will
show up just in time, and tell you to head for Estard Castle.  Go and do
that.  Walk up to the king, and a long sequence of events will unfold.
After the events are over and done with, you'll be back in your bed, just
like at the start of the game.  Go downstairs and take Mollie's Fish Sub to
Borkano (or just ignore him like you could before and talk to the chef
immediately).  Once again, Borkano will be inconsiderate towards you, and
tell you to go belowdecks and be a drudge for the chef.  Go down and talk
to the chef, then head back upstairs.  Some Messengers of God show up as
you arrive topside, and Borkano sends you off in his place, then sets sail.
Inconsiderate git, may he drown in a storm.  Head for the stairs, and
Maribel will show up and run off towards the boats.  Go talk to her and
Amitt, then head for Estard Castle.

 Inside the castle, go upstairs and talk with the minister.  Now, go down
and visit the banquet hall.  Talk to King Burns, who will ask you to take
a seat next to him; do so.  Agree to go with them, and the messengers will
leave.  King Burns will rally you and Aira together, and you will be taken
to the Crystal Palace (with Gabo tagging along, of course).

Location: Crystal Palace
Items: LifeAcorn x2, TinyMedal, Silk Garter, Final Key, Berserkr Helmet,
MysticNut, STRseed

 Quite a palace they built.  You'll be led into the palace proper, and up
to the audience chamber anteroom.  Here, King Burns will ditch you, and
you'll be free to raid the Crystal Palace of its goods.  Don't let the git
downstairs who's guarding the Final Key's door dissuade you; he won't stop
you from entering and nabbing it.  You'll see a few scenes in the process
of collecting the treasures, and probably end up getting things moving
again in terms of the plot.  Once you have everything, go sleep in the
bedroom where Beck and Ike are.  Head up to the audience chamber.  Melvin
will sneak you in.  How kind of him.  Go upstairs and talk to the guards of
the staircase twice.  Go upstairs, and talk to everybody (and I do mean
everybody).  Head for the staircase after this, and God will finally make
his appearance.  Note that he's speaking in silence, unlike before.  Hmm,
strange.  He commands that all throw down their weapons and never attack
anybody again (not even monsters).  Fishy.  He also takes your Dark Ruby
from you.  Now, go back downstairs and find King Burns; he's at the
entrance hall.

 Cutscenes aplenty follow, and nastiness abound, so pay attention!

Location: Estard Castle
New Items: Kings Sword, Platinum Shield, STRseed, TinyMedal x2

 Go talk to the minister, grab the items that the Final Key now gives you
access to (the second TinyMedal is down in the prison, in the unoccupied
cell), then head for Fishbel.  Apparently, something's happened to Borkano.
Go talk to Mollie at the docks to find out what.  Borkano was lost at sea.
Serves him right, if you ask me.  Mollie will encourage you to go and
thwart the evil, but how?  Return is blocked, so you can't escape the
island.  Go recruit Maribel from her room.  Now, return to the Fane.
Melvin will contact you!  Go check the statue, and he will inform you of
the situation.  Try going through the portals in the map room of the
Ancient Fane now.  After a short bit of dialogue, you'll be in control of
Melvin, up on the second story of the Coastal temple.

 Talk to the guard at the Great Lighthouse, and he'll tell you to go see
the king of Coastal if you want entry.  He's in the Halfling's cave, so
head on over and talk to him there.  He'll grant you permission, so head
back to the Great Lighthouse (so much walking about to do...), and on up to
the top.  Check the flame here, and the hero's party will once more be able
to travel through one of the gates (specifically, the one that leads to
Engow).  Back in control of the hero, step into the Engow gate.


In Search of the Fire Spirit				[D2FIRESP]
---------------------------==

 The volcano seems to have died down, big-time.  You can't go down into it
just yet, so head for Engow instead.  The people here are nervous, which
befits the situation.  Go talk to any of the guards of the torches around
town, and fend off the monsters that attack.  Now, go visit the elder of
Engow, talk to Pamela, and she will join you on your quest through the
volcano.  First, though, she'll ask that you go stop by her shop, and talk
to her assistant.  Do that, then head up the volcano.  If you talk to the
guard after he moves aside, you'll get access to the quick way down.
Either way, Make your way down into the area where the FireGiant used to
be.  There's a new entrance here!  Go on inside, and down into the true
core of the volcano.

Location: Mt. Flame Interior
Monsters: Rosevine, GoldSlime, CosmoBog, Magmaron, Hellbane, BoneRider
Items: Lava Staff, TinyMedal, STRseed, WorldDew

 As you progress down into the volcano, you'll see that it's far from dead;
quite otherwise.  The path through is very simple; I doubt you'll get lost,
it's only four screens of lava cavern.  Anyway, check the door in the last
area, and Pamela will call for her assistant.  She'll offer to tell you of
the Flame Spirit's origins, and once she's done, her assistant will run up
with the Flame Key and FlameAqua.  Now you can get into the Flame Spirit's
domain!  Enter, and use the FlameAqua on the volcano's core, as Pamela
instructs.  You'll have to battle the Flame Spirit now.

BOSS: Flame Spirit
HP: 5,500
Stretegy: Pfaw.  This isn't even challenging.  If you really are having
trouble with this battle, then I'd have to ask how you got this far in the
first place.  Even HellCloud is tougher than this guy.

 After the battle, you'll get the FlameChrm, and you'll be free to return
to Engow (via Outside would be best).  Back in Engow, the light seems to
have returned, though it's still dark on the world map.  Since you have no
further obligations here in Engow, return to Mt. Flame, and take the portal
back to the Ancient Fane.  Then, head back for Fishbel.  Talk to the girl
blocking the town's entrance to get her to move, then head for the docks
and talk to Mollie.  Agree to go look with Amitt, and talk to him.  Go
belowdecks and tell him you're ready to set out.  After some cutscenes and
some more flashbacks, you'll wake up on-board a mysterious ship.  The story
scenes will continue for some time.  I won't spoil anything here, though.

Location: Sharkeye's Ship
Gold: 20G
Items: Pirate Clothes x2, AmitSnack, TinyMedal x2, Turban, BluePrint,
STRseed, Captain Hat
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, SpiderWeb
Weapon Shop #1: Thunder Sword, Devil Claw, Bastard Sword, Sea Roar Staff
Armor Shop #1: Water Robe, Flame Armor, Gigant Armor, Dragon Robe,
Heal Shield, Mythril Helm
Weapon Shop #2: Dagger, Power Claw, Needle, Zombie Sword, Dragon Claw,
Godeus Sword
Armor Shop #2: Viking Armor, Captain Hat, Viking Helmet, Silver Shield,
Dugon Helm

 Now that the Fire Spirit is liberated and the Marle de Dragonne are on
your side, things are looking up.  You can also access the Dharma Temple
now at any time by talking to Caddell (the helmsman of Sharkeye's ship).
Be sure to loot the ship of its treasures (to find the second TinyMedal,
talk to one of the cats on the ship and say yes to it).  Once you're good
and ready, talk to Caddell and have him take you back to Estard, then make
your way back to the Ancient Fane, and on to wake up the remaining spirits.

NOTE: You can do the next two chapters in any order that you wish.  You
must complete both, however, to get to the final chapter of the game.

The Earth's Murmurings					[D2TERRASP]
---------------------==

 As you step through the portal, you'll find yourself in the sands outside
of Dune.  Go into town, and visit the elder.  He'll tell you to go to the
castle, so do that.  Visit the queen, who will actually allow you to speak
to her directly.  She will tell you to go see the shaman of the village.
She will also tell you to bring one of the village chief's sons with you.
Well, three of them are totally useless, so the choice is obvious, isn't
it?  Head back to Dune, and go see the elder.  His three sons are all
cowards (as you may remember from your first visit to Dune), but Saide
(the youngest) offers to go with you.  He's a lot like Hadeed was...
Anyway, once he's left, go follow him out back to his room, and talk to him
to get him to join you.  Now, to find the shaman.  He's not the guy in
front of the pot who lets you save, though.  He's the guy IN the pot who's
fishing.  Talk to him, and he'll head out to the area where the Traveller's
Gate (those glowing blue things are called that) to the Fane is.  Follow
him out there.

 Talk to the old man here, and he'll attempt to summon the Terra Spirit.
Unfortunately, he can't remember what the face looks like.  Might want to
go visit the elder of Dune.  He tells you that the answer probably lies in
the Fane of Dune Castle.  Head there, then, and speak with the queen again.
She'll let you enter the Fane.

Location: Dune Fane
Items: King's Key

 It seems you're not the only ones here.  Saide's useless brothers went and
snuck in.  They've nabbed something important, and are gloating.  As you
get closer, monsters attack.  The little twerps can't even defend
themselves...  Fight off the baddies attacking them, and they'll give you
the treasure.  Go and show the key they gave you to the queen, who will
tell you that it will unlock the Sphinx.  To get there, go back to Dune
Village, and enter the portal in the gigantic pot.

Location: Sphinx/Inverse Pyramid
Monsters: DemonToad, Gragoopi, Zombier, GoldKid, Slemperor, SkyDevil,
RedGrunt, EvlVulgar, BoltDevil, WoeBottle
Items: Mimic Heart, Seer'sGem, Rouge Gem, Nose Gem, Heart Gem

 Walk straight up to the woman in the rear of the first floor, and talk to
her so that she moves.  Go through the door, and down into the lower part
of the Sphinx.  There are clues for the puzzles of the coming dungeon
etched into the floor in the first area.  If you're planning to solve the
puzzles without the help of this guide, then you may want to read them.  On
the lower level, you'll find a chest with a Mimic Heart (maybe the Mimic
died and left it behind?), and the path to the Inverse Pyramid.

 The first floor is just your standard maze, not too difficult to figure
out at all.  Head upstairs instead of downstairs.  Up here, there's the
first puzzle.  The solution is simple: close all of the caskets.  The
Seer'sGem will show up.  One down, three to go!  Go through the lower door
of the puzzle room, and down the stairs that the passage leads to, and down
again on the next floor.  On the floor that follows, just pass through the
various doors to make your way to the stairway down.  The next floor has
another puzzle.  To solve this one, stand in front of the mouth until it
opens, then walk through and pick up the Rouge Gem.  Continue downstairs,
and again thrice more to the bottom floor.  Pick up the enormous Nose Gem,
then head back up to the previous floor.  From here, take the stairway up
that you didn't take before.  Pick up the Heart Gem here.  Now, Use it in
inventory, and you'll get the PierceGem, which is what you really need.
That's all four!  Feel free to use Outside to escape this dungeon, then
head back to the Traveler's Gate where the old man is.

 With all four gems in hand (make SURE that you've broken the Heart Gem in
two by using it!), talk to the old man, and he will revive the Terra
Spirit!  He will clear the desert of the blight of monsters (not really;
you'll still find them out there), and give you the TerraChrm.  Go back to
Dune Castle and tell the queen of what has transpired.  Now, on to the
next part!


Quest for the Wind Spirit				[D2WINDSP]
------------------------==

Location: Gorges
Gold: 7G
Items: Silver Tiara

 The blue-green portal room leads to the Lefa Fane.  Depart from there, and
head due south to Gorges, where you should visit the Pendragon's home.
After a short story scene, go inside her house and talk to her (after you
grab the Silver Tiara and 7G in the house).  Agree to help her out, and
then depart for the Wind Tower.

Location: Wind Tower
Monsters: DemonToad, Zombier, LampGenie, Zombie, Andreal, Hulkagon,
DeadNoble, Gerion
Gold: 1200G
Items: TinyMedal, Miracle Sword, AGL Scarf, DEFseed, AGLseed, (1 MadPot,
1 Mimic)

 The tower is pretty simple.  The majority of it is just a standard maze.
Grab the items lying about, and make your way to the top.  Check out the
altar up there, and after a bit of exposition, you'll be taken to SkyTown.

Location: SkyTown
Items: AGLseed, TinyMedal

 SkyTown is a bit different.  You can move around here by walking off the
edge of the world.  Yes, you read that right.   Go see the elder, and clean
up his house for him.  To do this, just pick up the papers and throw them
in the garbage can.  Once they're all thrown out, talk to the elder again.
It seems that the Wind Robe was stolen ages ago, and taken into the depths
of the Wind Maze (though the game accidentally calls the Wind Maze the
Wind Robe a few times...).  He gives you the Seal Key, which will let you
access the Wind Maze.  Go there after you've looted SkyTown completely.  As
you leave his home, the elder will hand you the Halo Orb, which gives you
easy access to SkyTown.  No longer will you have to scale the Wind Tower to
reach this place!  Anyway, after you've got the stuff, enter the sealed
portal, and the Wind Maze.

Location: Wind Maze
Monsters: Gerion, Andreal, Cerabus, EvlVulgar
Items: TinyMedal, Light Armor, Speed Ring

 This place is truly evil.  You need a solid grasp of 3D rotational
mechanics to get far in it.  It's also fairly long, and nigh impossible to
write an effective walkthrough for, though I'm giving it a shot.  In the
first area, walk to any of the edges, and around to the bottom side of the
platform.  Take the portal down there to the next part.  In this area, the
goal is to use the hole at the far end of the maze to fall down onto the
platform that leads to the next area.  This is easier than it sounds.  In
the fourth area, the TinyMedal is right next to the portal.  This is, by
far, the hardest area to guide you through.  Just follow the obscure path,
and you'll find the other two chests, as well as the hole that you need to
fall through to reach the portal to the next area.  Fortunately, this is
also the last area.  Check the chest, but it's empty!  Walk away, and a
boss will appear and fight you.

BOSS: Nengal
HP: 4,000
Strategy: He's just a Dumbira clone with a lot of HP.  Wipe up the floor
with his pansy arse.

 After being a total pansy about losing, the boss gives you the Wind Robe.
Now that you have that, just use the portal behind the empty chest to get
back to SkyTown.  Go pay the local Pendragon a visit (no, not Sefana; she's
in your party, remember?  The guy in the house full of trash).  His house
is a mess again, so you'll have to clean it up yet again.  Once the room is
spotless, talk to the Pendragon, and he'll give you the Wind Hat.  This
works like a free Return spell.  Whoopdedoo, Return only costs 1 MP anyway.
It can't even be used right now.  Now, head all the way back to the Lefa
Fane (yes yes, I know, long trek) and use the Wind Robe on the Spirit
Statue.  With the Wind Spirit awake, she'll give you the WindCharm, and
head for Dharma.  Sefana will also ditch you now.  That's that, so on to
the next goal!


The Fall of the Evil One				[D2FINAL]
-----------------------==

 Get back onto Sharkeye's ship.  Big-time story sequence, so watch and
enjoy.  Melvin's back in your party now, and Maribel's run back home.

 NOTE: Finally, the limit on the immigrant town has been lifted.

 With the world once again at your fingertips, you have two options open to
you: power your characters up, or go take on the last dungeon.  I'd suggest
the former, if your classes are lacking.  You can shift your party around
now by visiting Maribel's room, but you can never have more than four party
members at one time.  Now would also be a good time to visit the Undersea
King and Gracos.  The Undersea King's domain is north of Sim's town.  Talk
to him twice to tell him about the monster in the Coral Cave who doesn't
want to be a monster, and he'll tell you to tell that monster to come to
him.  Once you do that, the monster will give you a free ? Shard.  Next up,
go pay Gracos V a visit again, and he'll give you the treasure in his other
chest, a Demon Spear.  Finally, go back to the Coral Cave via the pedestal
in the Sky Fane, and talk to the kids running around in there for another
? Shard.

 Once you're good and ready for it, head down into the Dark Palace.  You
can reach the palace interior only with the Sky Stone.

Location: Dark Palace
Monsters: WoePreist, RainHawk, Drakorpse, Swordbane, Disguiser, MetalyS,
Druinlord, GigaDraco, DeathGron, Bludbeast
Gold: 1250G
Items: TinyMedal x3, LarMirror, Life Ring, WorldLeaf, Sorrow Shield,
BluePrint (3 MadPot, 1 DorasBox)

 The first part of the palace is just a rehash of the Crystal Palace, but
with monsters.  Head on down into the prison where you got the Final Key,
and down into the massive hole in the floor.  This is the true Dark Palace.
The path down through the stone part of the palace is pretty simple, but be
sure to grab the chests along the way (one of which has the LarMirror, and
another has a TinyMedal).  Eventually, you'll reach a cave that leads to
the second part of the palace, the cave part.  The way through is simple
enough (and contains yet another TinyMedal), and brings you to (for lack of
a better term) the organic portion of the palace.

 The first floor of the organic area is uninteresting, so keep going down
to the next one.  Keep your distance from the pulsing yellow globs, as they
will transport you to different areas if they catch you with their tongues.
A few lead to treasure chests, however, so don't be afraid to try a few of
them out.  Specifically, the two nearest the closest island lead to a chest
on the next floor down, and the one next to the chest with 1250G leads to
the chest with the WorldLeaf, as well as the exit to the next area.  After
a few caves, you'll be back in another organic section.  The pulsating huts
here somtimes contain eggs with monsters in them, so be careful.  The
Sorrow Shield is the only item in any of them, so once you have that, just
head straight for the last hut.  You'll have to fight a few monsters in
eggs to reach the exit, on the upper right wall.

 Continue through the next area to the moving floor room.  Here, your goal
is to get to the BluePrint, and to explore the caves in the area.  One of
the caves has a TinyMedal hidden completely about 5 steps up from a skull.
Follow the moving pathways to reach the central cave in the room, and enter
said cave.

 Now you've come to an intersection of sorts.  To proceed, you have to use
one of the Charms that the elemental spirits gave you.  This means that
there are four paths you can take to get to Orgo Demira.  Look below for
the exact details of which path you chose.  Note that, in order to get all
of the ultimate equipment, you'll have to use Outside and go through all
four of the paths.

Terra Cave
Monsters: DruinLord, EvlVulgar, DarkSnail
Items: Gaiala Armor, TinyMedal

 To move about here, you'll have to check the walls.  If a wall is a
breakable one, then it will shatter, allowing you to progress.  Be sure to
get the TinyMedal and Gaiala Armor before you enter the portal leading to
Orgo Demira.

Aqua Cave
Monsters: SeaDragon, Octogon, GeratMerm, Varanus, Shellgator, EvilDiver
Items: Oceano Sword, ? Shard

 The path here is fairly straightforward.  The Oceano Sword is situated in
the area where the portal to Orgo Demira rests, so you'll have to go all
the way to the end, even if you're just here for the equipment.  The
? Shard is along the way, so you shouldn't miss it.

Flame Cave
Monsters: HellHawk
Items: Fuego Helm

 This path is a lot like the volcano at Engow.  The helmet is found along
the way, so keep an eye out for it.  (NOTE: If you're wondering, fuego is
Spanish for flame, hence the helmet's name.)  At the end of the cave,
you'll find a portal leading to Orgo Demira.

Wind Cave
Monsters: 
Items: Tornado Shield

 Sort of a rehash of the Wind Maze, but infinitely easier to complete.  Be
sure to nab the Tornado Shield before you enter the portal and face off
Orgo Demira.

 Regardless of which path you chose, you'll end up being delivered to a
room with a lot of platforms.  Step on the platforms and rise to the top
level, where you'll be face to face with that nasty lord of demons, Orgo
Demira.  He'll berate you a bit, then fight you.

BOSS: Orgo Demira (Orgodemir)
HP: 12,000
Strategy: This is it, the big one.  Orgo Demira is even thougher than he
was last time, and has two extra forms, to boot.  Use your best attacks
available, and keep up with your healing.  He'll probably come close to
beating you a few times (and might even succeed, if you're not careful),
but don't give him any quarter, and he'll die before you know it.  Having
an ally with high HP and MP set to the Heal tactic that has HealAll,
HealUs, and Revive is a good idea.

 After all that, the battle is over at last.  The world is saved!  You'll
be taken to several places as the game's ending slowly progresses, and you
can walk around and talk to the people during these sequences.  The last
destination is Estard.  If you're planning on taking on the bonus dungeons
after this, don't go and see the king just yet.  Instead, head back into
town, and down into the well.  Nab the LostShard, and take it to the
mysterious chest out on the cliff, past the grate.  After you've saved the
Shard onto your memory card, then go talk to the king.

 Congratulations!  You have won Dragon Warrior VII!  Now, go play something
fun.  Just kidding, just kidding...


                   Epilogue - The Hero's March
                  ==-------------------------==

 At last, you've won the game.  The final boss is defeated, and now you
probably want to know what there is left to do.  Well, the game's plot may
end with the defeat of Orgo Demira, but the gameplay options do not.  Grab
yourself a bag of Cheesy Poofs, because the epilogue is about to commence.

 The majority of the epilogue is centered around two very special dungeons:
Replica Cave and Zion Castle (my own names for them, mind you; their
Location names are just Cave and Castle).  Accessing these dungeons starts
with the Lost Shard that is found in Estard during the ending sequence.
You have to take the Shard and put it in the chest on the far side of the
cliff, and then open the chest when you next load your saved data.  That
Shard is the final one required to access the first bonus dungeon.


Bonus Dungeon #1 - Replica Cave				[EPBONUS1]
------------------------------==

 The bonus dungeons are beyond the grate in the central rear room of the
Ancient Fane (where you were always putting the previous Shards into
pedestals during the main game plot).  Using the Final Key, open the prison
door in the rear of the room, and go down the stairs.  The pedestal there
is the key to the first dungeon.

PEDESTAL: Replica Pedestal (Ancient Fane basement)
PIECES: Sunken City (present; given to you by Gracos V for defeating him),
Estard (put the LostShard into the chest on the cliff to get it), Coral
Cave (past; given to you by the ghost children after defeating the Demon
Lord), Medal Castle (redeemed for 100 TinyMedals)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 100

 The cave is not far from the portal.  Go enter it.

Location: Replica Cave
Monsters: Barbarian, HelKaiser, Darksanta, Gigagoner, Satanmail, BudooLamp,
Budoo, Baskervil, DrakMetal, Makainite, PomPomBom, Golemuga, RushFish,
Starfish, SeaLipsy
Gold: None
Items: STRseed x2, TinyMedal x3, SageRock, Life Ring, Magic Hat,
Slime Clothes, (MadPot x2, MadBook x1, WellGhost x1)

 Upon entering the dungeon, you might find the terrain a bit familiar.
There's a good reason for this: every single room in the Replica Cave is
from other dungeons.  Areas marked with a * have no random encounters.
Here's an overview of the various areas replicated:

Room #1 - Mt. Tor cave
#2 - Ancient Fane
#3 - Deja Tunnel
#4 - World's Tallest Tower
#5 - *Old Man on the Cliff's House (Estard)
#6 - Halfling Cave (Costal)
#7 - Deja Tunnel
#8 - Volcano Core (Engow)
#9 - *DarkDraco's Tower (Loomin)
#10 - Coral Cave
#11 - Timespace (Litorud)
#12 - Cave to Rainbow Lake (Estard Isle)
#13 - Basin Cave (Mardra)
#14 - Mountain Path (Mentare)
#14a - West Cave (Orph)
#15 - Waterfall Cave
#16 - Mountain Village (Dharma) (You can save here, mercifully)
#16a - Well in Mountain Village
#16b - House in Mountain Village
#17 - *Ancient Fane
#18 - *Probably the only unique location in the cave

 The path through Replica Cave is very straightforward indeed, and at the
end of the dungeon, you'll find yourself face-to-face with the last
character you would ever expect to find in a dungeon.  Even more ridiculous
than that is that this character wants you to battle him.

 Do not read past this point if you haven't reached the end of Replica
Cave!

 The boss you have to fight is none other than God.  What is it with RPG's
and slaying deities?  Anyway, he's one tough boss (which befits a deity, I
suppose).  You'll want to employ standard boss tactics, as well as using
MagicWall (so that his HellBlast attacks don't hurt as much), and possibly
even WakeSong (if he puts half or more of your party to sleep).  If you can
defeat him fast enough (I believe the limit is 30 turns, then 25 turns,
then 20 turns for every time you battle him afterwards), he'll give you a
choice of rewards.  For now, you should focus on getting the ? Shards, so
you can reach the second bonus dungeon.  Once you have all three, it's time
to venture down below the Replica Cave pedestal, to the final pedestal of
the game.


Bonus Dungeon #2 - Zion Castle				[EPBONUS2]
-----------------------------==

PEDESTAL: Zion Pedestal (Ancient Fane basement)
PIECES: Coastal (present; bought in the casino for 2000 coins), Coral Cave
(present; help the monster in the Coral Cave by talking to the Undersea
King on his behalf), Immigrant town (present, normal final form; found in
the secret store room in the back of town), Aqua Cave (found in a chest in
the cave), Replica Cave (defeat God three times, asking for one of the
three ? Shards each time)
AREA LEVEL LIMIT: 100

 The castle is clearly visible from here.  Go ahead and enter it.

Location: Zion Castle
Monsters: DorasBox, PlatKing, MadPlant, DemoKing, Deathgon, Esterk,
HellHawk, NiteKing, DarkMage, DragonWoo
Gold: 
Items: TinyMedal

 This dungeon, much like its predecessor, is comprised of other dungeons.
Here's an overview.

Room #1 - Dune Castle (exterior)
#1a - Tor Mountain cave (Labres)
#2 - Inverse Pyramid (Sphinx)
#3 - Halfling Cave (Costal)
#4 - Volcano Core (Engow)
#5 - Under Dharma
#6 - Volcano Core (Engow) (Has a healing spot!)
#7 - West Cave (Dharma)
#8 - Demon Lord's Castle
#8a - Mt. Ceide (Orph)
#9 - Dharma Back Entrance
#10 - Sky Fane
#11 - House in Dune

 As with before, the path is straightforward and hard to get lost along
(seeing as it's made up of other dungeons).  Once again, you may not want
to read past this point until you reach the final areas of the dungeon.

 The bosses of Zion Castle are the four elemental Spirits.  You have to
fight them all together, but they should be a breeze compared to the far
more powerful boss of the first bonus dungeon.  I don't think there is any
turn limit, but it shouldn't take much more than 10 turns, if even that, to
wipe the floor up with these big-headed fools.

 Once you're past the spirits, continue on to the last room of the dungeon,
to find none other than that jolly old psycho himself, God!  Feel free to
invite him to live in your immigrant town, it certainly can't hurt (indeed,
it will mean that you won't have to go through Replica Cave ever again to
face him).  And that, as they say, is a wrap!  There's nothing left to do,
save collect more items from beating up God, completing the various side-
quests that remain, and mastering all classes.

 Now you really have won Dragon Warrior VII.  Really.  Totally and
completely.  You can stop reading now.  You can, you know.  I'm serious,
stop reading.  I'm not going to write another line after this one, you
know; it's really the last one.

Appendix A: Monsters and Taming				[APPENDIXA]
------------------------------==

HOW TO TAME MONSTERS

 Monsters can be tamed by using the Tamer skill on them (gained from the
Tamer class from the first star level).  This skill will do nothing until
you have the BeefJerky item, though (which you get from the Monster Park
manager after finishing Loomin).  Tamer increases the chances of monsters
turning tame by 25% for each use.  Odds of a monster going tame after
battle is determined by the enemy's Tame Factor; most early enemies have a
Tame Factor of 5 (very easy), and later ones have factors of 1 or 2 (very
hard).  Take note that the Tamer skill must be used by the same character
every time for it to have a cumulative effect (so two Tamers aren't going
to improve your chances for taming a monster; quite the opposite).  You can
only tame one monster per battle.  All of the monsters in Zion Castle are
immune to Tamer, but not to the two food items (Rib and Fillet), which also
act like Tamer, but raise success by 50% and 100%, respectively.  Note that
some enemies will ignore these items if your level is too low.

THE MONSTER PARK

 The park starts out with only one area.  It can be extended by giving
blueprints to the monster park's owner.  The BluePrint items are located as
follows:

* Graveyard: KingSlime boss in Northern Tower drops it (present)
* Mountain: Barrel in Gorges (past)
* Ocean: Chest in the Coral Cave (present)
* Plateau: Chest on Mt. Tor (past)
* Forest: Chest in the Halfling Cave (past)
* Desert: Prize at Coastal Casino (present)
* Swamp: Chest on Sharkeye's Ship (present)
* Cave: Chest in the Dark Palace (present)
* Tower: Reward for turning in 75 TinyMedals (present)

 To get a BluePrint upgrade to take place, you need to stay at an inn or
sleep in your bed at home after giving it to the monster park director.
Basically, make a day pass.

MONSTER LIST

 There are plenty of baddies in this game.  This is a guide to the ones
found in the monster book.  It's been designed to act as a checklist so you
can keep track of which monsters you've seen and tamed, as well as find out
how much experience and gold monsters give.

Appendix C: The Immigrant Town				[APPENDIXC]
-----------------------------==

 The immigrant town can be populated by people from almost any town in the
game, and even from a few non-town locations.  The following types of
people can come to the town:

Man
Male
Woman
Female
Grandma
Grandpa
Scholar
Farmer
Halfling
Cow
Bull
Pig
Horse
Cat
Kitty
Feline
Soldier
Warrior
Swordman
Dancer
Mixer
Bunny(girl)
Sailor
Prisoner
Bully
Merchant
Trader
Priest
Sister

 You can find any of these various types of people at any of the spawn
spots scattered about the world, all in the present (but of course).  The
locations are as follows...

Location	Spawn Spot
Estard		Inn, on the second floor, in the smaller bedroom
Rexwood		Inn, in the back of the bedroom
Engow		Inn, in the middle of the bedroom
Orph		Inn, in the bedroom
Orph		Item Shop, in the area behind the counter
Falrish		Inn, in one of the bedrooms
Falrish		Church, near the outside entrance
Mentare		In the house along the Geionne path, in the middle
Verdham		Wandering about the western area
Last Inn	In the middle of the basement's pub
Mezar		Inn, near the entrance
Dune		Inn, in the bedroom
Krage		Inn, at one of the tables
Litorud		Inn, at one of the tables
Litorud		Church, sitting on one of the seats
Hamelia		Inn, in one of the bedrooms
Hamelia		Pub, somewhere...
Sphinx		3F, next to the stairs leading to the fourth floor
Probina		Inn, right next to one of the beds
Probina		Armor shop, in the middle of the room
Loomin		Inn, in the bedroom
Mardra		Inn, in the bedroom
Mardra		Church, sitting in the lower right seat
Mardra Castle	In the old king and queen's bedroom (now empty)
Great Fane	Below the fane, in the dirt area before the stairs up
Gorges		Inn, in the entry hall
Labres		Inn, in the bedroom
Coastal		Inn, second floor, hard to miss
Coastal		Church, second floor, also hard to miss
Coastal		Armor shop basement, standing in the middle of the room
Excavated Cave	Near the eastern entrance

 Most of these spots are easy to force townspeople to appear, while others
are horrible (particularly Dune's inn).  Your chances for an immigrant
appearing are roughly 1 in however many you've recruited so far for the
town.  The odds seem to improve if you haven't been looking for immigrants
recently.  Spawn spots can be used repeatedly without leaving the area, but
what fun is that?

 As well, there are five special spawn spots, where permanent residents
will wait for you.  They don't spawn other residents, but the people there
will always be there until you go and grab them.

Location	Immigrant Location
Dharma		Second floor, standing around (Trader)
Mezar		Walking around between the inn and church (Dancer)
Avon Temple	Standing around inside (Sister)
Loomin		Sitting at a table in the inn (Farmer)
Lefa Fane	In the back room with the barrels (Priest)

TOWN SIZES AND VARIATIONS

 As you bring more people in, the town grows and changes.  Here's an
overview of those changes.  The town won't be able to go past 27 people
until disc 2, even if you meet people in the immigrant spawn spots, so be
sure to keep that in mind when hunting for immigrants late on the first
disc.

People	Town Appearance
0-4	The town doesn't exist; it's still an empty field
5-9	A tent appears in the field, and Sim asks you to name the town for
	him, with three suggestions based off of the hero's name; Sim can
	now be found in a house on the far end of the island
10-14	The town has a building, two more in progress; merchant appears
15-19	A shop opens, more buildings appear
20-24	An inn appears, and Sim will allow you to manage the people as you
	see fit (kicking them out, trading them, etc.)
25-29	A church is built (can't save there, though), and a few more shops
	appear
30-34	A bank shows up, and the shops change their wares
35-40	Final form; see below for details

FINAL FORMS OF TOWNS

 There are five final forms that your town can take, depending on who lives
there.  Note that those towns with names listed as # name/name mean that
you need at least one of each, with an overall total of the number listed
for them.

Regular Final Town
Requires: None (if you don't meet the requirements for any of the special
final form towns, this is what you get)
Items: Traveler Clothes, TinyMedal, ? Shard, King's Armor, (1 DorasBox)
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, SpiderWeb, WarpWing, Repellent
Weapon Shop: Destruct Sword, Dragon Tail, Flame Claw, Lune Fan, War
Hammer, Hero Staff
Armor Shop: Steel Armor, Wizard Robe, Magic Armor, Mirror Armor, Dragon
Shield, Platinum Helmet, Great Helmet
Notes: This is the easiest to get, since it's nothing special.  Be sure to
get it so you can get the ? Shard from the town's hidden store room,
though!

Farming Town
Requires: 13 Farmers, 10 Halflings/Cows/Bulls/Horses/Pigs
Gold: None
Items: TinyMedal, Boxer Shorts, Leather Boxers, Dung, LifeAcorn, Rib
Item Shop: Sickle, Hacksaw, Monster Fangs, Oricon Fangs, Boxer Shorts,
Leather Boxers, LifeRock
Notes: This town sells Oricon Claws, Gabo's best single-hitting weapon.
Other than that, it's not worth it (unless you want all TinyMedals).

Super Bazaar Town
Requires: 21 Merchants/Traders
Gold: 160G
Items: TinyMedal, MysticNut, Wyvern Heart, Life Ring
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, MoonHerb, SpiderWeb, Star Ort, LifeRock,
Speed Ring
Item Shop: Slime Earrings, Slime Clothes, Slime Armor, MetlKing Shield,
SeaShell Hat
Weapon Shop: Dragon Tail, Flame Claws, Platinum Sword, Tempt Sword,
Bow Gun, MetlKing Sword
Armor Shop: Party Dress, SilkTux, Trendy Clothes, Turban, Silk Hat, Tights,
Bow Tie
Notes: This town has a fair amount of useful weapons for sale (including
MetlKing Swords), but unless you're after all TinyMedals, you should
probably not bother with it.  You can also buy Ribs from here for 694G, but
only if you have none at the moment, and just like the WorldDew shop, you
have to wait in line.

Great Cathedral Town
Requires: 20 Priests/Sisters
Gold: None
Items: None
Item Shop: Herb, Antidote, Repellent, Potion, LifeRock, Wizard Ring,
Vivify Staff
Equipment Shop: Wind Staff, Holy Spear, Sage Staff, Lune Fan, Sun Fan,
Spirit Armor, Water Clothes
Notes: This town is utterly worthless.  No TinyMedals, nothing useful for
sale in the shops, nothing worth the effort.

Grand Slum Town
Requires: 10 Bunnies/Mixers/Dancers, 8 Bullies, 6 Sailors/Prisoners
Gold: 160G, 16G, 7G
Items: TinyMedal x2, STRseed, DEFseed x2, LifeAcorn, Dung, Bunny Ears
Weapon Shop: Power Claws, Shears, Dragon Tail, Flame Boomerang,
Seduce Sword, Devil Sword
Armor Shop: Viking Armor, Dance Armor, Silk Coat, Spangle Dress, Garter,
Tights, Bunny Ears
Notes: This should be the last of the special towns you build, as it has an
indispensible casino with great prizes.

EXCHANGING AND DISPOSING OF TOWNSPEOPLE

 Once Sim lets you manage the people of the town, you can start kicking
people out and exchanging them for other people on other saves.  You can't
kick anybody out of town if the population is below 25, so keep that in
mind when planning final-form towns.  Exchanging with another save is a
great way to make a final town of your choosing, and you can actually cheat
with this option by saving two files for your exchanging game, and only
trading with one of the saves.  Once you load up that other game, you'll
still have everybody, and you can save over the modified save, and get all
of the townspeople you took again.  But beware: you can never kick people
out of your town who have been transferred there from other players' towns!


Appendix D: Litorud Rankings				[APPENDIXD]
---------------------------==

 Once Litorud is unsealed, you can participate in the rankings contest.
If a character wins a ranking contest, they are awarded with a plaque and
an item.  This is what each character gets for winning each award:

	Power		Intelligence	Style
Males	Power Ring	Intelli Helmet	Platinum Armor
Females	Power Ring	Tiara		Spangle Dress

 The trick to winning at any given point is to have your stats be boosted
abnormally high.  Sometimes it won't be enough, and other times, it might
be too much.  If you want to win all of the prizes for the rankings, you'll
want to have characters with the lowest score in each stat get first prize
first, and move up from there.  Try to get Maribel to win the Style and
Intelligence awards early on, and once Melvin is in the party, aim for
him getting the Intelligence award.  Being in the right class for the title
is also important, of course.  The bigger the boost for the stat being
judged, the better.  You can even semi-cheat by re-registering previous
winners with lower scores than they had originally, thus allowing your less
stat-endowed characters to gain awards, as well.

 The Appearance rankings have some hidden appearance bonuses from certain
equipment combos:

Combo							APR Bonus/Total APR
Demon Hammer + Demon Armor					10	55
Slime Armor + Slime Earrings					10	48
Aquagon Sword + Dolphin Shield					10	90
Dragon Sword + Dragon Armor + Dragon Shield			15	112
